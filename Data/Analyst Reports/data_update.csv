0,22/02/2024,Honeywell's Security Acquisition Will Augment Growth in 2024-25,Honeywell International Inc,HON,4,01/02/2024,Brian Bernard,199.53,USD,21/02/2024,229.0,Medium,Wide,Exemplary,A,01/02/2024,"Honeywell's shares traded lower on Feb. 1 after the wide-moat firm released its fourth-quarter and full-year 2023 results and provided 2024 guidance. Fourth-quarter revenue grew 3% (2% organic) to $9.4 billion, segment margin expanded 60 basis points to 23.5%, and adjusted EPS increased 3% to $2.60. While adjusted EPS came in $0.01 above the FactSet consensus estimate, revenue fell about 3% shy of consensus, and managements 2024 revenue outlook of $38.1 billion-$38.9 billion fell short of the $39.0 billion consensus expectation. Performance across Honeywells legacy segments was mixed. Recall the firm will report re-segmented results in fiscal 2024. Aerospace organic revenue increased 15% year over year and segment margin improved 20 basis points to 28% amid strong commercial aviation original equipment demand and solid growth within defense and space. Building technologies organic revenue slipped 1% and segment margin contracted 90 basis points to 23.9% as weaker demand for short-cycle building products and cost inflation more than offset solid demand for long-cycle building solutions and productivity initiatives. The performance materials segment delivered 4% organic growth with 200 basis points of margin expansion (to 24.0%) as demand was solid across end markets and profitability benefited from favorable mix and productivity gains. Safety and productivity solutions was the laggard during the quarter, with organic revenue down 24% and segment margin 290 basis points lower to 17.3%. Management said warehouse automation project volumes remain in the doldrums. Nevertheless, we remain bullish on Honeywells long-term prospects in warehouse automation. Looking ahead to 2024, management sees 4%-6% organic sales growth, 30-60 basis points of segment margin expansion, 7%-10% adjusted EPS growth, and free cash flow of $5.6 billion-$6.0 billion.We maintain our $229 per share fair value estimate, but we will revisit our model assumptions after the firms 10-K is filed.","Honeywell is making several organic bets in mission-critical end markets that should yield triple-digit IRRs over the long term, including in quantum computing and building automation. Honeywell boasts one of the strongest balance sheets in the multi-industry universe, and it has a history of underpromising and overdelivering on its targets. With safety and productivity solutions seeing a meaningful drop in sales in 2023, this will meaningfully help margins because of positive mix, and allow SPS to eventually hit 20% operating margins.","Honeywell trades at a considerable premium to its sum of the parts, and the stock price is a crowded trade that bakes in a lot of optimism and requires near-perfect execution to justify its assessment. Honeywell's large organic bets like quantum computing or its partnerships with SAP are promising, but won't move the needle in the medium term, which poses problems amid rising interest rates. Over half of Honeywell's portfolio is exposed to a short-cycle recession.",19/12/2023,"Honeywell is one of the strongest multi-industry firms in operation today. We think the company has successfully pivoted to capture multiple ESG trends, including energy efficiency, emissions reduction, and e-commerce, among others. We predicate our long-term thesis on increased demand for warehouse automation solutions, despite tough 2023 comps; new digital offerings that promote data analytics in powerplants, as well as remote security management, and energy savings in building solutions; and the broader commercial aerospace recovery. Over the next five years, we think Honeywell is capable of mid-single-digit top-line growth, incremental operating margins in the high-20s to low-30s, between 9% and 10% adjusted EPS growth, and free cash flow margins in the midteens. We believe Honeywell is capable of meeting our assumed targets through a combination of portfolio refreshes, powerful new product introductions, breakthrough initiatives, and strategic partnerships in areas where the firm has domain expertise, a focus on high-growth regions that'll help the firm grow faster than its core markets, continuous improvement initiatives centered on fixed cost reduction, on-time delivery and simplified design, supply chain automation, and an increasing shift toward software with a recurring revenue stream. In our view, Honeywell was wise to continue investing aggressively during the height of the pandemic, which we think will eventually reward the firm with share gains. Despite appreciable near-term headwinds due to customer warehouse overbuilds, we believe COVID-19 only accelerated the need for automation given the strong secular trend toward e-commerce. Many of Honeywell's automation solutions offer customers meaningful return on investment from greater productivity. Furthermore, we think Honeywell is strongly positioned to lead in carbon capture, given its large installed base and investments in solvents. Finally, we like that Honeywell is reorganizing its portfolio among its most important secular trends in aerospace, automation, and the energy transition. We think this will drive more focus in operations and better capital allocation decisions.","We view Honeywell as one of the highest-quality companies in the diversified industrials space and assign the firm a wide economic moat. We attribute this rating primarily to intangible assets and switching costs. Over a normalized cycle, which includes 10-year historical figures and our explicit five-year projections, we estimate that Honeywell earns about a 18% to 19% return on invested capital, inclusive of goodwill, or about 9 percentage points above our weighted average cost of capital of 8.5%. Furthermore, in none of these historical years, including the global financial crisis in 2008 nor the pandemic-induced recession of 2020, did Honeywell's ROIC ever fall below our estimated cost of capital. As such, we have a high degree of confidence in Honeywells ability to generate excess returns 10 years into the future, and believe it is more likely than not it will continue to do so 20 years into the future.Key to Honeywell carving a wide moat, in our view, is the firms increasing ability to leverage its software technology across its massive industrial installed base. This software technology is integrated into both mission-critical operations, as in cockpit control during commercial aircraft flights, and in customer operations, through diverse offerings like warehouse automation in factories or connected solutions in buildings.In our opinion, aerospace is Honeywells widest-moat business, both from a qualitative installed base perspective, and from a quantitative returns-based perspective.Importantly, the segment has maintained outperformance even through periods of top-line contraction, which increases the confidence in our rating. Furthermore, Honeywell boasts one of the largest installed base in the industry, including over 36,000 auxiliary power units, 25,000 engines, 20,000 wheels and brakes, 20,000 flight management systems, over 100 connected offerings, and over 10,000 units of satellite communication hardware. Aerospace is traditionally a razor-and-blade model. To beat competitors selling the razor and ultimately add to the installed base, Honeywell relies on its intangible assets. Specifically, these include superior technology, know-how, its long record of success, customer relationships, and to a lesser extent, patents. We think its superior technology stems from research and development, which we estimate represents about 4.5%-5% of the segments sales, is appreciably larger than at most other diversified industrials across our coverage (which on average, spend about 2%-3% of sales).Honeywells R&D expense as a proportion of sales, however, undersells the benefit Honeywell derives from R&D endeavors. The firm also gets a lift from its government relationships, primarily with the U.S. government. We consider the U.S. government relationship vital when coupled with Honeywells long record of success, such as its historic contributions to American spaceflight. The U.S. government typically adds an additional 50% to the firms R&D investment, funding Honeywells total spend of just over 7% of its annual sales. In other words, Honeywell gets the sales benefit from this research without having to incur the additional expense. Because of its R&D efforts and technical know-how, Honeywell has virtually shut out other competitors in awarded contracts for avionics (aviation electronics), auxiliary power units, and mechanical systems (for example landing gear) since 2013. Between 2008 and 2017, Honeywell captured a 35% increase to its aircraft installed base. From 2018 to 2022, the firm anticipates it will have 2.7 times the amount of avionics, 2.1 times the amount of auxiliary power units, and 1.5 times the amount of mechanical systems on new aircraft deliveries relative to its competitors, based on awarded platforms.Relatedly, switching costs are strongly associated with higher-margin aftermarket sales. Aftermarket sales can broadly be broken down into two subcategoriesthe conventional aftermarket, the blade in the razor-and-blade model, which is tied to traditional flight-hour service contracts for maintenance, repair, and overhaulas well as decoupled offerings, which break away from the traditional razor-and-blade model and relate more to discretionary spending customers make for aircraft upgrades. For either model, we think Honeywell benefits from switching costs given its equipments strong integration into customers airframes and landing systems. For the conventional aftermarket, the additional installed base has allowed Honeywell to have 30% more content per aircraft, and an increased share of maintenance service contracts, providing the firm with an annuitylike revenue stream. The firms decoupled offerings have high switching costs given they perform tasks associated with a high cost of failure. These include in-flight health monitoring via satellite communication and landing assistance software. We think performance materials and technologies, or PMT, is another wide-moat segment. We think this segment benefits both from intangible assets thanks to superior technology, regulatory barriers, and intellectual property, as well as switching costs from recurring revenue in aftermarket services. PMT is a mix of three business lines with large installed bases, including universal oil products, or UOP, which sells catalysts and adsorbents to the oil and gas industry, process solutions, which sells industrial software solutions, and advanced materials, where it sells fluorine products like its Solstice molecule, as well as chemicals and polymers. The firms acquisition of Elster, which partially folded into PMT in 2015, for example, gave it access to 200 million utility metering modules in portions of the U.S. and Europe, deployed over 10 years prior to its IPO in 2010. Honeywell is rapidly transforming this industrial installed base and overlaying it with software and data analytics on the heels of energy efficiency initiatives and mandates. We suspect that this will benefit Honeywell by allowing it to stay a step ahead of its competitors through enhanced visibility over its installed base. Our best quantitative evidence of switching costs from the segments installed base, given its exposure to the oil and gas industry (at nearly 50% of revenue), is its ability to turn a profit even during large drops in the price of oil. During 2015-16, segment profits grew 14% even as the price of oil dropped by 55%, all while PMT maintained larger margins than peers. For the segments intangibles, we think the forest matters more than the trees, but believe the Solstice molecule represents a good example of the firms know-how and research and development efforts put into practice. This is a duopoly business with Chemours. The Solstice molecule is a chemical compound used in a variety of cleaning and aerosol applicationsspecifically medical, metal, and electronic applicationsthat complies with high safety and environmental standards but is as effective as hydrofluorocarbons. Moreover, Solstice remains a liquid for an extended period compared with alternatives, given its low boiling point but high heat of vaporization. Additionally, the Solstice molecules unique properties give it a low surface tension but a high degree of solvency, allowing it to clean tight spaces. Importantly, it is the only U.S. Environmental Protection Agency-approved product designed for use in machine flushing operations in HVAC and refrigeration cleaning. While this product may seem imitable given sufficient resources, according to Reuters, Honeywell began developing HFC alternatives as far back as 2000 and committed $900 million total to this research effort. The environmental impact is also minimal relative to HFCs, with a global warming potential of less than 1 versus 1000 for HFCs. As for the building technologies segment, we believe it merits a narrow moat. We think the same moat sources are at work with a connected installed base created by intangible assets like superior technology offerings, valuable relationships with contractors, and a well-regarded reputation from over 100 years of operations, followed by recurring revenue on the heels of aftermarket service requirements indicating switching costs. Additionally, building technologies has moved away from single product sales to an ecosystem of smart commercial products. Unlike winner-takes-all markets, we believe the commercial device market is one where a few players can thrive playing in the same sandbox. Honeywells building technologies integrates functions with high risks of failure, like security and fire monitoring, with other critical business operations, like energy usage and climate control. These solutions have the added benefit of alerting customers in the event of occurrences like power outages or maintenance needs, which provide the segment with additional recurring revenue (for example alarm monitoring or service dispatch in the event of alarm).Additionally, we think safety and productivity solutions, or SPS, has a narrow moat, even as we believe it offers the conglomerate the most promising sales growth prospects. While we see the same moat sources in play as in the rest of Honeywells segments, we assign a narrow-moat rating because just over half of SPS revenue base is in new markets with a less certain future, given earlier life cycles; and service revenue only constitutes about 6% to 7% of segment revenue (compared with a low-20s percentage mix for HBT and PMT, or 40%-plus for aerospace). These early-cycle products and services include the firms warehouse automation offerings, for example. Specifically, warehouse automation refers to automating a variety of aspects of repetitive and error-prone operations, from storage and retrieval to software systems. Warehouse automation is one of the last frontiers where companies can significantly reduce their long-term manufacturing costs. According to St. Onge, only about 5% of warehouses are automated in the United States. This market is still fragmented but is increasingly consolidating, and were convinced Honeywell strengthened its competitive position and will remain on top with its acquisition of Intelligrated, a top robotics company that fits well with Honeywells previously limited handheld and voice recognition portfolio. The other portion of the SPS includes more old-world products, which we consider moatier given their comparably greater history of excess returns, including personal protective equipment and high-risk safety equipment that depends on intangible assetsspecifically, brand recognition and a reputation for reliability.","We assign a Medium Morningstar Uncertainty Rating to Honeywell, with a greater level of uncertainty to the upside, given the firms increasing exposure to software offerings. Raw material inflation can have an impact on its cost inputs, which may be difficult to offset with increased pricing in certain markets. Aerospace is a long-cycle business that can have a prolonged downturn period depending on global demand for air travel, as well as military defense spending, which can face headwinds like sequestration threats in the U.S. Home and building technologies faces headwinds in the event of a slowdown in global residential and commercial construction, and performance materials and technologies faces similar prospects with downturns in the oil and gas market. That said were less concerned about normal ebbs and flows of the macro environment, given that Honeywells business is split 60/40 between operating expenditure and capital expenditure cycles.In SPS, the biggest concern we have includes rapid changes in technology, which can obviate the impact of some of Honeywells software investments and translate into diminished returns on capital projects relative to the firms expectations. In the near term, the biggest risk is the fallout related to the global coronavirus pandemic on Honeywell's aerospace business, as well as the drop in the price of oil per barrel to well below what we saw in the industrial recession, and its effect on Honeywell's PMT segment.Environmental, social, and governance risks include legacy site environmental liabilities, asbestos liabilities, a Foreign Corrupt Practices Act investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice related to UOP's former third-party contractors in their dealing with Petrobras, and any potential embargo from the sale of defense systems. Of these, we think the biggest risk comes from asbestos and environmental liabilities, but these are known and baked into all three scenarios of our model.","We assign Honeywell an Exemplary Morningstar Capital Allocation Rating based on its sound balance sheet, exceptional investments, and appropriate shareholder distributions. The firm has one of the strongest balance sheets in our coverage, with a net debt/EBITDA level that typically runs about 1 times. Second, we commend management for making promising growth capital expenditures investments at the height of the pandemic to take share from competitors. We expect the firm will earn significant economic profit from these investments. Finally, we like management's disciplined M&A process and its unwillingness to overpay for growth.We think CEO Vimal Kapur is well suited for the role given his decades-long track record of success in increasingly important positions of responsibility within Honeywells portfolio, including leading the building technologies and performance materials and technologies segments. We think he'll work to refocus Honeywell's portfolio among its most important secular growth trends in the energy transition, automation, and aerospace.Prior to becoming CEO, Kapur was named COO, a move that was initially said to free up former CEO Adamczyks time to contemplate M&A, but aside from the $1.3 billion agreement to purchase quality management software provider Sparta Systems back in late-2020, it really hadnt done much in the way of M&A. That changed with the $670 million acquisition of Compressor Controls Corporation in 2023. We concede that evaluating portfolio changes isnt always abundantly clear to the market and that prices havent always been favorable. However, we would have thought Honeywell could have taken advantage during the pandemic-related selloff to deploy more capital, particularly in smaller bolt-on deals. Broadly speaking, however, we agree that not lowering the companys hurdle rates is the right move.Kapur certainly has his hands full getting Honeywell back to its normal growth algorithm given some operating headwinds, particularly with slowing near-term growth in building technologies, negative near-term growth in safety and productivity solutions, particularly related to warehouse automation, and to a lesser extent, the impact of supply chain disruptions on aerospace margins, though those appear to be abating. Warehouse automation is clearly resetting from the pandemic-related e-commerce tailwinds, so over the long term, we expect a return to growth.We continue to speculate that GE and Honeywell may one day consider merging some portion of their aerospace portfolios to combat the likes of Raytheon Technologies and others, but we think antitrust could become a stumbling block in that regard as it did in the early-2000s in Europe. ","Honeywell traces its roots to 1885 with Albert Butzs firm, Butz-Thermo Electric Regulator, which produced a predecessor to the modern thermostat. Today, Honeywell is a global multi-industry behemoth with one of the largest installed bases of equipment. It operates through four business segments: aerospace, building technologies, performance materials and technologies, and safety and productivity solutions. In recent years, the firm has made several portfolio changes, including the addition of Intelligrated in 2016, as well as the spinoffs of Garrett Technologies and Resideo in 2018. In 2019, the firm launched Honeywell Forge, its enterprise performance management software solution that leverages the firm's domain expertise in buildings, airlines, and critical infrastructure.","We think Honeywell operates from a very strong financial position and believe its credit risk is very low. Honeywell boasts one of the lowest net debt/EBITDA ratios of any of the U.S. multi-industry firms we cover at 1.2 times at the end of 2022, though prior to 2020, that figure has been at or below 1 times since 2012. In fact, we credit its balance sheet strength as one of its greatest assets during the pandemic as it was allowed to maintain its growth capital expenditures plans while other competitors froze growth capital expenditures spending in 2020. Furthermore, Honeywell's interest coverage ratio (EBIT/interest expense) stood at 15.5 times as of the end of 2022, meaning Honeywell has ample firepower to service its interest payments. Finally, Honeywell's pension and other postretirement benefits have a minimal effect on our fair value, as its pension is overfunded, and its other retiree benefits deduct a mere $0.15 per share from our fair value estimate."
1,22/02/2024,Nasdaq Acquires Adenza as It Pursues Its Vision of Becoming a Diversified Technology Company,Nasdaq Inc,NDAQ,3,31/01/2024,Michael Miller,56.04,USD,21/02/2024,55.0,Medium,Narrow,Standard,B,31/01/2024,"Narrow-moat-rated Nasdaq reported decent fourth-quarter results. Solid performance in solutions revenue was offset by weaker performance at the exchanges and integration-related expenses. Net revenue increased 23.3% from last year to $1.1 billion, or 6.5% when adjusted for the acquisition of Adenza. On other hand, earnings per share declined to $0.36 from $0.48 last year due to acquisition-related costs and share dilution. As we incorporate these results, we do not plan to materially alter our $55 fair value estimate. Nasdaqs index business continues to benefit from higher market valuations, with index revenue increasing 25.9% from last year to $146 million. Nasdaq receives most of its index revenue from fees based on the amount of assets linked to its indexes, creating a direct link between market performance and Nasdaqs business. Moreover, because of the success of the Nasdaq 100 index, the business is particularly sensitive to the volatile technology sector. In general, we expect average revenue growth in the high single digits from the index segment, though results in any given quarter can be volatile. Next quarters results will benefit from an easy year-over-year comparison, but after that, we anticipate more muted growth. Nasdaq's anti-financial-crimes business, now known as regulatory technologies, had another good quarter, with revenue increasing 17% from last year to $96 million. Growth was supported by continued strength in the antifraud business, Verafin, which grew 25% year over year. Verafins strong performance in recent quarters has helped justify the hefty $2.75 billion price tag Nasdaq paid for the business in 2021, which had initially been a concern. Nasdaq has also begun to find success in expanding Verafins client base to Tier 1 and Tier 2 banking clients, extending the growth runway for the business. This record lends more confidence in the acquisition of Adenza, though we still see material execution risk from the deal.","Nasdaq continues to see strong growth from its newer more data-focused business lines as the company continues to invest in its data and technology offerings. Nasdaqs market data and brand are valuable intangible assets that the company has monetized through its listings, index, and data products. The companys listing business has outperformed in recent years, winning the majority of newly listed securities. ","Nasdaq continues to face growing competitive pressure at its exchanges, with two new competitors launching in 2020. Nasdaq has seen considerable industry and regulatory pushback on the pricing of its market data products, limiting its ability to grow revenue through price increases. The Adenza acquisition was not cheap. At 18 times expected 2023 revenue, Nasdaq is paid a significant premium, creating risk for shareholders if the firm cannot execute on its planned revenue and expense synergies.",28/11/2023,"Nasdaqs exchange business continues to produce strong results as volatile markets lead to good trading volume industrywide, with Nasdaq's option exchanges in particular performing well. While we expect trading to normalize over time, the increased prevalence of $0-commission trading platforms and a shift toward higher option volume should provide a persistent benefit to Nasdaqs exchanges. However, the equity exchange business remains highly competitive, and two new exchanges were launched in 2020, Members Exchange and the MIAX Pearl Equities Exchange, adding to the competitive pressure Nasdaq faces. Additionally, Nasdaq has seen continued pushback from clients and regulators on the pricing of its market data products. These pressures add credence to Nasdaqs efforts to transition itself away from its exchanges business and become a diversified technology company. As part of this reorientation, the company has focused its attention on the growth potential of its solutions businesses, which Nasdaq believes can grow organically 8%-11% over the next three to five years. Nasdaq continues to invest in these businesses both organically and inorganically, with the $10.5 billion purchase of the financial technology company Adenza being the most recent acquisition. While we like this strategy for Nasdaq, the scale of the transaction and the high price Nasdaq paid gives us pause. Nasdaqs recent track record for acquisitions has been strong, but the deal has added meaningful execution risk to the company as it is by far the largest purchase Nasdaq has ever done and will push the firm's leverage ratios to all-time highs.  That said, the company is pursuing opportunities with large total addressable markets, such as antifraud services and financial compliance, which create a long runway for growth. Additionally, Nasdaq is a beneficiary of the recent recovery in technology stocks through its index business, as high market valuations will lead to higher AUM-based fee revenue. Additionally, low IPO volume has been a headwind in 2023 for its listing business, typically a strong performer, but higher market valuations increase prospects for a recovery in 2024. ","Nasdaq has a Narrow Morningstar Economic Moat Rating that we think will allow it to continue to earn returns on invested capital above its cost of capital. While Nasdaq remains a leading firm among equity and options exchanges, the companys moat is defended primarily by valuable intangible assets as Nasdaq has created substantial recurring revenue sources through the value of its data offerings as well as the strength of the Nasdaq brand name. The companys success in monetizing its valuable intangible assets comes in a variety of diversified business lines, such as licensing its indexes to futures contracts or offering market data from its equity and options exchanges. Outside of its exchanges and their associated revenue streams, Nasdaq has built broad product offerings in the corporate services and investment analytics spaces using a combination of acquisitions and organic investments. This allows it to fulfill multiple product needs as a single provider and further reorients the company toward being a financial data and services provider over its legacy exchange business. We generally assess the economic moats of financial exchanges as primarily stemming from network effects and intangible assets. As more buyers and sellers use a financial exchange, the order book deepens and bid-ask spreads tighten. More trading volume generally leads to better liquidity, which allows buyers and sellers to enter and exit their positions with less impact on the price of the asset, reducing implicit trading costs. Depending on the asset being traded, the benefit of having less market impact is often greater than any savings that could be achieved by using another exchange with lower explicit transaction costs, creating network effects for exchanges with existing liquidity. However, this is not the case at Nasdaqs cash equity and options exchanges. Unlike the futures and swaps offered by some of Nasdaqs competitors, cash equity and options can be sold at a different exchange than the one they were purchased at. Additionally, alternative trading systems like dark pools provide additional tools for large investors to lower implicit trading costs without the help of Nasdaq or the other exchanges. The result of this is that trading volumes at equity exchanges are price-sensitive, and major exchanges offer substantial rebates in order to attract volume. Competition among exchanges for volume keeps fees down, and Nasdaq generally captures only about $0.04 to $0.05 of net revenue per 100 shares traded on its U.S. exchanges. Despite weak pricing power among equity exchanges, new competitors have still intruded on both the cash equity and options sides of Nasdaqs business, as it is not especially difficult to enter the market and Nasdaqs major counterparties have historically encouraged further competition in the exchange industry. IEX launched its equity exchange in 2016 and the Members Exchange (MEMX) was launched in 2020. MEMX in particular was founded by some of Nasdaqs largest counterparties and enjoys strong industry support. So far, the market share gained by these new entrants has been limited, with both generally falling between 2% and 3% of total equity trading volume. In the options industry, Nasdaq has also had to deal with the success of the Miami International Securities Exchange, or MIAX, growing to roughly 14% of total volume since its debut in 2012 as well as MIAXs recent expansion into cash equities in 2020. While none of these new entrants have significantly impaired Nasdaqs trading business, their continued presence highlights that this segment lacks defenses from competitive threats. Were we to evaluate Nasdaqs equity and derivative trading business as a stand-alone company we would likely give it a no-moat rating based on these competitive dynamics. However, Nasdaq can generate associated revenue from its trading business through the use of its intangible assets to sell data, listing services, and licenses for its indexes. While Nasdaq participates in the common tape system, Nasdaq can sell a more complete data set to investors, including a full view of its order book and historical prices. Because of the size of Nasdaqs market share, this data is necessary for traders to have a complete view of the market. Additionally, as trading has become automated, the speed that an investment firm receives its data has become critical, making rapid access to exchange data a business necessity for some trading firms, and Nasdaq is able to sell connectivity services to firms that allows them to connect directly to Nasdaqs exchange data. While industry and regulator pushback on Nasdaqs data prices has increased this, the companys data assets remain highly valuable. Nasdaq also has the strength of the Nasdaq brand, which makes it desirable for companies to be listed on the exchange. The companys listing services is run under a three-tier system in which companies listed in the upper tiers must meet more stringent requirements and pay higher annual fees. New companies are encouraged to be listed on Nasdaq to prove their legitimacy, and existing firms are have incentives to list with Nasdaq since it makes them eligible for Nasdaqs family of indexes. Nasdaq has also historically been known to be favored by technology and disruptive companies, creating a more growth-oriented brand name that many firms want to attach to their shares. Nasdaqs brand remains strong, and the number of firms listed on its exchange continues to steadily rise as IPOs choose to list on the Nasdaq exchange and the company occasionally steals listings from the New York Stock Exchange. Once listed on Nasdaqs exchange, companies face switching costs, as leaving Nasdaq renders them ineligible for Nasdaqs indexes, reducing demand for their shares. Changing listing locations also requires going through the initial listing process again at a different exchange and being listed by either the NYSE or Nasdaq can often be engrained in a companys legal structure. While these hurdles are relatively modest, listing fees are generally quite low, ranging anywhere from $50,000 to $200,000, meaning that even a minor inconvenience is likely not worth the effort to a company.The same intangible asset, in the form of the Nasdaq brand, drives Nasdaqs index business as well. Nasdaq operates a family of indexes, with the most well-known being the Nasdaq composite index, which remains one of the most followed indexes in America. Nasdaq has been able to use this broad recognition to license its indexes to investment providers for the creation of exchange-traded products based on its indexes. Nasdaq then charges the investment providers a percentage of its assets under management as a recurring fee to use its brand name on their product. Additionally, Nasdaq offers licenses to create derivative products based on its indexes. Once these licensed products are created, Nasdaqs counterparties face switching costs that make it difficult for them to stop working with Nasdaq. Dropping the license with Nasdaq would require an investment provider to migrate existing investors from the Nasdaq-branded products, placing their AUM at risk in the process. In a similar vein, there is no guarantee that traders using derivatives tied to the Nasdaq index will migrate to another equity-linked product at the same firm if the license is not renewed. As a result, we see Nasdaqs index business as being relatively captive once it has been built. All in all, cash equity and equity option execution can be seen as a loss leader that enables Nasdaqs profitable data- and service-driven revenue streams to persist and grow. These revenue streams also make it more difficult for new exchange competitors to take significant market share since they will be forced to compete on price against Nasdaq without these alternative revenue sources. We expect that competitive pressure at its equity and option exchanges will slowly eat away at its position over time, but the associated recurring revenue sources Nasdaq has built using its valuable data and brand name should allow the firm to continue earning returns above its cost of capital for some time. As a result, we believe that Nasdaq has created a narrow moat around its business that will allow it to earn returns above its cost of capital.","Nasdaq has a Medium Morningstar Uncertainty Rating. The main points of uncertainty are that the performance of many of its business lines are tied directly to market events and the higher debt levels the firm took on as part of the Adenza acquisition. The companys exchange revenue is based on the volume of trading that occurs on its exchange, which in turn is heavily influenced by the amount of trading that is occurring across the entire market. This can add countercyclicality to Nasdaqs exchange revenue, as periods of increased market volatility generally lead to higher trading volume. On the other hand, Nasdaqs index business earns most of its revenue through fees that are charged as a percentage of AUM. Thus, this revenue stream increases or decreases with AUM of the exchange-traded products that license Nasdaqs indexes, which fall or rise with the market. As Nasdaq continues to transition toward being a diversified data and technology company, it becomes more weighted toward recurring revenue sources. Recurring revenue now makes up more than 50% of Nasdaq total revenue and will continue to increase, as the company completes its acquisition of Adenza. This should increase the stability of Nasdaqs earnings, though the increased leverage from the $5.9 billion in debt that will be issued as part of the Adenza deal will add financial risk to Nasdaq. This is partially mitigated by the firm's strong cash flow and recurring revenue sources, but we believe debt reduction should be a priority for the firm following the acquisition. Nasdaq has relatively minor environmental, social, and governance risk. If a security transaction tax were passed in the U.S., it would do significant damage to the companys exchange business. However, this remains a remote possibility, in our view. We see more threat from the SEC's efforts to reform the U.S. common tape, though Nasdaq is less reliant on this revenue then it once was.","Nasdaqs capital allocation rating is Standard. While Nasdaq's balance sheet has historically been strong, the Adenza acquisition added considerable leverage to its balance sheet. While we do not think this rise in its debt load will put the company in financial risk, given its strong recurring revenue base, Nasdaqs financial flexibility will be constrained until the company can reduce its debt load. We are encouraged by the deleveraging plans Nasdaq included with the announcement and see its goal of returning to a net debt/EBITDA ratio of 3.3 times within 36 months as achievable in light of the firm's strong free cash flow. We also view Nasdaqs distribution policy as appropriate. The company generally returns around 35%-40% of its net income to shareholders as dividends and uses about two thirds as much for share repurchases. We generally agree with this policy, as it leaves Nasdaq with some flexibility in its capital allocation as the company continues to use inorganic investments to drive its transition away from its foundational exchange business toward its vision of being a diversified technology company. The company should have room to maintain and grow its dividend following the Adenza acquisition, but expect minimal share repurchases in the near- to medium-term. We view Nasdaqs decision to focus its investments on its investment intelligence and market technology favorably, and we see promise in Nasdaqs goal of becoming a diversified technology company. However, Nasdaqs history with integrating and growing the business it acquires is spotty. The company recently announced the sale of its fixed-income trading business to Tradeweb after years of disappointing performance. This segment was originally built through the acquisition of eSpeed from BGC partners in 2013 for more than $1 billion. The $190 million that Nasdaq expects to receive from the sale represents a material loss of value for shareholders. That said, since Adena Friedman has become the CEO of Nasdaq, the company has been far more effective in its investment strategy, and we view its transition efforts favorably, particularly given the firm's notable success with its listing and index businesses in recent years. Additionally, its 2021 acquisition of Verafin has progressed well, with the business expanding its client base to include tier 1 and tier 2 banking firm. This new investment strategy along with a decent balance sheet and distribution policy earns Nasdaq a Standard rating, though a great deal relies on Nasdaq's success or failure with Adenza, as the $10.5 billion price tag makes it the largest purchase in the company's history.","Founded in 1971, Nasdaq is primarily known for its equity exchange, but in addition to its market-services business (about 35% of sales), the company sells and distributes market data as well as offers Nasdaq-branded indexes to asset managers and investors through its information-services segment (30%). Nasdaq's corporate-services business (20%) offers listing services and related investor relations products to publicly traded companies and through the company's market technology group (15%), Nasdaq facilitates the exchange operations of other exchanges throughout the world and provides financial compliance services.","Nasdaqs financial strength has historically been strong, but the acquisition of Adenza in November of 2023 added significant leverage to the firm.At the end of September 2023, Nasdaq had just over $9.7 billion in debt and over $5.6 billion in cash and investment securities as it prepared to purchase Adenza, giving it net debt/EBITDA ratio of 2.6 times. However, the bulk of this excess cash was used to finance the acquisition, and Nasdaq assumed nearly $2 billion in debt from Adenza as part of the transaction. As a result, the firm's leverage ratio has climbed to over 4.7 times, a new high for the firm and well above the 3.5 times Nasdaq reached after its $2.75 billion acquisition of Verafin in early 2021. While this is a considerable amount of debt for the firm to hold, much of Nasdaqs revenue come from reliable recurring sources that are resistant to impairment from market cycles. Additionally, Nasdaq's exchange business can benefit from higher trading volume in volatile markets adding the potential for countercyclical behavior to the companys market-services revenue. Given the stability of Nasdaq's revenue generation we do not see a serious financial risk to the firm from the additional debt load. That said, this much leverage will constrain its financial flexibility and investment options. As such, we'd like to see the firm focus on reducing its leverage over time and appreciate the firm's goal of deleveraging to a net debt/EBITDA ratio of 4 times by 18 months after the deal closes (and 3.3 times after 36 months from the closing of the deal). Based on our projections, we see these targets as being achievable due to the firm's strong cash flow."
2,22/02/2024,Want Want China to Benefit From Lower Input Costs in Fiscal 2023,Want Want China Holdings Ltd,00151,4,28/11/2023,Jacky Tsang,4.44,HKD,21/02/2024,6.0,Medium,Narrow,Standard,,28/11/2023,"Narrow-moat Want Want China's fiscal 2023 (ending March 31, 2024) interim results were broadly in line with our expectations thanks to stable top-line growth and alleviating input costs. Operating profit rose by 20% year on year as the company improved channel efficiencies. We left our fiscal 2023 forecasts largely unchanged and retain our fair value estimate of HKD 6.00 per share, which implies 16 times fiscal 2023 price/earnings and 9 times EV/EBITDA. We think its shares are undervalued, with market's concern about slower medium-term growth priced in. In our view, the adverse impact from its reliance on legacy products is not new. We expect Want Want to modestly refresh its portfolio and enter new channels to protect its current margins, but such an approach would result in muted top-line and profit growth. Revenue increased by 4% year on year, slightly below our forecast. The dairy segment was the major driver, though snack food sales were sluggish and weaker than our estimate. Rice crackers revenue benefited from momentum in overseas markets, whereas lower palm oil prices drove notable margin expansion. Want Want still used higher-priced milk powder inventories for the fiscal first half, which led to only moderate margin improvement for the dairy segment. However, management confirmed that lower input costs would kick in for the fiscal second half. We are constructive on the well-controlled selling expenses, which drove operating profit above our estimate. In the fiscal second half, we think Want Want could benefit from gifting demand during Chinese New Year for both its food and beverage segments. In the near term, we are more positive on its dairy segment due to stronger festive demand, but we acknowledge the slower growth outlook in the medium term. We continue to project a stable operating expense ratio in the fiscal second half. We think the dairy segment would see more notable margin expansion with lower milk powder costs and operating leverage.","Want Want has developed a scalable offline channel network in China, which has enabled the vast distribution of its flagship products and maintained its brand awareness among Chinese consumers. With decades of expertise in packaged food and beverage, the company is well-positioned to refresh its product portfolio with new offerings. All three sub-segments carry high levels of gross margin compared with industry peers, signifying the companys ability to achieve both scale and profitability.","Want Wants lower-than-industry-average online mix would be a hurdle for the company to stay compete when emerging brands penetrate the market with new offerings via this channel. The company is overly reliant on a few lineups such as Hot-Kid milk and rice crackers, which could significantly dampen its profitability in the long term when consumer tastes shift away from these products. The companys cautious approach in managing its portfolio and channel structure could drag its responsiveness to changing market demand and impair its profit outlook.",28/11/2023,"Want Want China derives revenue and profit mainly through a few flagship packaged food and beverage products that it developed decades ago, including Hot-Kid milk, sugar-coated rice crackers, savory senbei and QQ candies. The companys products have particularly been popular among children. Margins are maximized through scaling these flagships with its nationwide offline distribution channel. Leveraging on its brand and the vast distribution network, the company has been able to achieve higher levels of gross profit and operating margin compared with domestic peers, with the majority of earnings distributed to shareholders.  However, top-line growth has slowed in recent years as its portfolio aged and the online channel started to encroach on offline sales. Want Want has responded to these changes by cautiously increasing the mix of emerging channels and differentiating its existing offerings across various distribution channels. The company has been able to increase the mix of emerging channels in recent years, which lifted sales of new products, as well. However, Want Want still relies heavily on traditional distributors as its profit drivers and these channels have had low penetration of new products. In the long term, we expect slow sales growth because its aging portfolio would cause its offline channel partners to increasingly demand higher margins in retaining shelf space and maintaining the channel relationship, which would also dampen Want Wants margins. The company would need to continue investing in new products to drive volume growth aside from price growth. Although these investments would pose short-term profit pressure, we think it could help Want Want return to a growth path, which is beneficial for its long-term profitability. ","We assign a narrow moat rating for Want Want China, as its distribution network developed since the late 1980s constitutes an intangible asset that resulted in its return on invested capital, or ROIC, trending materially above WACC at over 30% since 2016. We expect Want Want to be able to generate ROIC above WACC for the next 10 years.Founded in Taiwan in 1962, Want Want China entered the mainland Chinese food and beverage market in 1989 with its pioneering Want Want branded rice cracker product, which the company developed with a Japanese rice cracker producer in the early 1980s. The company has built a scalable offline distribution network since its entrance in the late 1980s, with 9,000 distributors across the country as of March 2021. The huge sales volume for its flagships, for instance, dairy, rice crackers and candy, has enabled the company to develop entrenched and sticky relationships with its channel partners, who often favor products with high visibility in sales such that profits can be assured. Want Want has set up a network to penetrate lower-tier counties and maximize its reach. Lower-tier cities account for about half of its total sales. For top counties within prefectural-level cities, the company has dedicated channel partners for each of its major product segments. Offline distributors account for roughly 80% of Want Wants total sales, whereas emerging channels including e-commerce, vending machines, maternal and Want Want theme stores account for a high-single-digit percentage proportion of revenue. A mix of modern channels such as supermarkets, hypermarkets and convenience stores also accounts for a high-single-digit percentage of its total sales, and are likely higher in Tier 1 cities, while distributors play a bigger role in lower-tier cities. During the pandemic year in 2020, the company took initiatives such as financing tools to alleviate the operational pressure faced by its distributors, which shows the firms strategic relationships with these partners. Want Want has also assisted its existing channel partners to promote online and offline integration and experiment with digital transformation. We think this further proves the company is conscious about preserving its relationship with the offline distribution network, even at the cost of slower progress in new channel development. We acknowledge Want Wants emphasis on securing store counts and shelf space as offline shopping and impulse purchases have been pivotal consumption contexts for snacks and beverage that target children and parents. The company has introduced customized stock-keeping units, or SKUs, that are only distributed to modern channels, which we think is a good strategy to differentiate across channels. While Want Want distributes directly to modern channels, we note that margins could be lower than for the distributor channel, as marketing expenses for the former are higher. The company also has to bear accounts receivable instead of shifting that to channel partners. A differentiated strategy in product mix and execution across channels serves to diversify its distribution structure in accordance with the companys goal of preserving profitability.Want Want has a leading market position in the rice cracker and flavored milk segments, which together formed its well-known household brand name in the Chinese market. Its products are especially popular among children aged 6 to 12. Despite the low barrier of entry and competitive nature of the snack food and beverage market, Want Want has developed a portfolio targeting niche sub-segments. Through its strong brand identity and scalable distribution channel, the company was able to generate sizable revenue with only a few flagship products, conducive to stronger profitability in our view. The Hot-Kid milk lineup alone generates roughly CNY 10 billion, or half of its total sales annually. This sub-segment has prompted similar launches by Yili and Mengniu such as QQ Star Milk and Future Star Kid Milk. Its rice cracker segment--most notably the flagship sugar-coated crackers and savory senbei--contributes around 25% (or roughly CNY 5 billion) of company sales. Want Want has a market-leading gross margin level of high-40% across its rice crackers, dairy and snack food categories. This compares to an average 20% to 30% range for peers including Tingyi, Uni-President China, Mengniu, Yili and other snack food producers like Three Squirrels, Bestore, Qia Qia food and Hao Xiang Ni. With a similar level of selling, general, and administrative expenses, or SG&A, as industry peers, Want Want is able to consistently yield a respectable operating margin of over 20%, materially above its peers in China. Based on historical birth rate data published by the National Bureau of Statistics, the size of population aged between 6 and 12 has grown at an average year-on-year pace of 2% from 2016 to 2020, but should have peaked in 2022 given the peak in birth rate in 2012. As birth rate has shown a declining trend for the past eight years with the loosening of the one-child policy in 2015, we do not expect a sharp and consistent rebound despite the three-child policy announced this year. As a result, we expect the size of population aged 6 to 12 would decline from 2022 onwards, putting a cap on the total addressable market for Want Want China. We expect, however, that per-child spending will increase due to appreciation of quality by Chinese parents in merchandise purchases, as reflected in a recent study by QuestMobile. We therefore believe the company will have opportunities to grow its profit if new launches cater to the changing preferences of consumers, for instance lower sugar, fat or sodium content. While premiumization should remain a key direction for consumer goods companies in China for the years to come, we think dairy products for children could potentially see slower trade up than snack food as the former gradually become a necessity in the pursuit for a healthy lifestyle, which transformed the category into part of the child-rearing burden and is an area the government would prefer alleviating rather than intensifying, as reflected in numerous policy initiatives recently. ","Our Morningstar Uncertainty Rating for Want Want China is Medium. Major risks to the firm's long-term profits and cash flow include changing consumer preference for snacks and beverages as well as fluctuations in commodity prices. According to a China Food Association whitepaper on the children's snacks market, nutrition value and the amount of food additives are the two most important considerations in parents' decision-making process. Want Want's flagship Hot-Kid milk, rice crackers, and snack food generally carry low nutrition value. As a result, there exist risks to longer-term sales growth.Want Want's major commodity inputs include milk powder, sugar, rice, palm oil, and starch, accounting for about 18%, 5%, 4%, 3%, and 3% of its cost of goods sold, respectively, on our estimates. Like other packaged food and beverage makers, the firm is susceptible to fluctuations in input costs, as reflected in fiscal 2017 (ended March 31, 2018) and fiscal 2021. Gross margins for its dairy category since 2018 demonstrated inverse relationships with milk powder prices, which are set to have an adverse impact on fiscal 2021 and 2022 margins. The ESG risks Want Want encounters include food safety concerns, potential new nutrition standards, and resources usage. Given Want Want's good record, we think the probability of food safety issue is low. We would, however, highlight that the government could enforce new nutrition standards to achieve standardization and quality assurance. In 2020, the China Food Association promulgated the first ""General Requirements for Children's Snacks,"" which specified requirements for additives and preservatives contained in children's snacks. We think as regulations targeting snacks for children aged 6-12 become increasingly standardized and transparent, industry players including Want Want would have to comply with relevant laws and adjust their products accordingly, incurring additional costs.","We rate Want Want Chinas capital allocation as standard, mainly driven by our assessment of the firms mixed distribution policy and its sound balance sheet. We think the companys financial leverage is appropriate, as its debt/EBITDA is higher than domestic peers like Tingyi and Uni-President China--but below that of peers like Mengniu, Mondelez and Nestle. We think the company has sufficient cash to repay its debt obligations and it has retired part of its long-term debt following the peak in fiscal year 2019 (ending March 31, 2020). The company sits on close to CNY 20 billion in cash and cash equivalents, which we think provides a sufficient cushion to support its high distribution policy. Want Want China invested in its manufacturing base in Vietnam as part of its plan to expand overseas, which we think is the appropriate investment to make in order to boost medium-term growth prospects. Given the intense competition in China, it could be a beneficial move to tap developing markets and the Chinese population in Southeast Asia. The company has maintained a distribution policy of roughly 80% over the past few years in the form of cash dividend and share buybacks. Some of the shares repurchased, however, have been executed at higher-than-market prices, resulting in our mixed view assessment. We think the firm will not change its high payout ratio in the near term due to the absence of acquisition targets and significant investment initiatives. The proportion of profits distributed should remain at around 80%, according to our estimates.","Want Want is major player in the China packaged food and beverage sector. The company was founded in 1962 in Taiwan and entered the mainland Chinese market in 1989. Its flagship products, such as Hot-Kid milk and Want Want rice crackers, are market leaders in the respective sub-segments. With a primary focus in mainland China, the company also exports to overseas markets. As at March 2021, Want Want China had 422 sales offices, 35 production bases and 81 factories on the Chinese mainland and worked with around 9,000 distributors.","Want Want China is in solid financial shape and we think the company will have no difficulties in fulfilling its debt obligations or refinancing. We project its leverage ratio and financial health to be broadly stable. Its current and quick ratios of 1.8 and 1.4 are higher than most of the domestic and international packaged food and beverage makers, thanks to its abundant cash balance. The companys debt/capital ratio of 30% sits close to the average of domestic and international peers, with debt/EBITDA and EBITDA/interest expense ratios landing at around 1.2 and 26 times, respectively. All of these metrics have improved over the past five years and fared well versus industry peers, suggesting sound management in its capital structure. We expect these ratios to be broadly stable barring any sizable acquisitions, though falling EBITDA in our forecast would have to be accompanied by lower leverage if the current financial status is to be maintained."
3,22/02/2024,RWE Keeps Outperforming Thanks to Its Competitive Power Generation Mix and Operational Excellence,RWE AG,RWE,5,06/02/2024,Tancrede Fulop,31.18,EUR,21/02/2024,55.0,Medium,None,Exemplary,C,06/02/2024,"The German government agreed on Feb. 5 to tender up 10 gigawatts of new gas-fired power plants. It is willing to provide EUR 17 billion of subsidies, according to Reuters. Those plants should be able to switch to hydrogen between 2035 and 2040. The German government also said it intends to introduce a capacity mechanism for existing baseload power plants by the middle of the year that would be functional by 2028. This capacity mechanism, already in place in other countries like the U.K. and Belgium, has long been awaited for Germany. RWE announced that it would partake in the auctions for the 10 GW of combined-cycle gas turbine plants. This is not surprising, since RWE already planned to build 3 GW of flexible generation capacity in Germany by 2030 (gas plants that can be fully decarbonized by 2040). The firm had explicitly said that it would not invest without government support. We have not incorporated those investments into our valuation yet, but doing so will not have a material impact, as we reckon they will account for 5% of the group's investments by 2030. RWE is well positioned to benefit from the implementation of capacity payments thanks to its 4.5 GW of CCGTs in Germany. Those capacity payments should have a high conversion rate to earnings and cash flow since no material investments will be needed to collect them. It is difficult to assess the amount of the future capacity payments. The average unit capacity payment in the U.K. from 2024 to 2027 (based on auctions held four years in advance) amounts to GBP 32/kilowatt. Applying this amount to RWE's German CCGTs points to annual incremental EBITDA of around EUR 140 million and earnings per share accretion of around 5%. Still, pending more clarity, we maintain our earnings estimates and EUR 55 fair value estimate, which offers 62% upside from the current depressed share price.","Reducing coal exposure could entice more ESG-focused investors and help reduce the discount of RWE's renewables operations versus peers. Since the acquisition of Consolidated Edison's large clean energy business, RWE became the fourth-largest renewables firm in the U.S., a very attractive market since the adoption of the Inflation Reduction Act.  Thanks to its flexible CCGTs, RWE is very well positioned to benefit from the tightening of the reserve margin in Europe as well as the growing intermittency from renewables high growth. ","Rising construction costs and competition will weigh on renewable projects' returns.  Earnings of the supply and trading business could drop should the volatility of commodity prices normalize. With a greater exposure to merchant power prices than other renewable developers, RWE's earnings would be significantly hit by a normalization of power prices in Europe. ",19/01/2024,"After splitting off its noncommodity businesses into Innogy in October 2016, RWE retained only its conventional generation and commodities businesses, along with a 77% share of Innogy. Under a large asset swap with E.On, RWE sold its stake in Innogy to the latter while retaining Innogys renewables business, receiving E.On's renewables division as well as a 15% stake in E.On. The deal was completed in 2019. The rationale was stronger for RWE, which doubled its renewable capacity and became the second-largest global offshore wind firm.  RWE has around half of its renewables production exposed to merchant power prices, more than most peers. This implies a higher exposure to rising power prices. A EUR 10/MWh change in power prices has a valuation impact of EUR 3 per share, or 5% of our fair value estimate. RWE is still significantly exposed to coal, with 9.7 gigawatts of capacity at end-2022, 28% of the total, of which 8.25 GW is lignite in Germany. In October 2022, RWE reached an agreement to advance the exit of coal and lignite plants from 2038 to 2030. The planned coal exit could entice more environmental, social, and corporate governance-focused investors and reduce the discount of RWE's renewable operations versus peers. With 14 GW of net capacity, RWE has the second-largest fleet of CCGTs in Europe. With the tightening of the power reserve margin in Europe due to the shutdown of many coal and nuclear plants and more intermittency from renewables growth, CGGTs become highly profitable. RWE intends to build more of them to compensate the upcoming additional closures of coal plants but will do so only if it gets a regulated remuneration program. The German government is expected to make announcements on this front by the end of 2023.  With the acquisition of Consolidated Edison's large clean-energy business in March 2023, RWE became the fourth-largest renewables firm in the U.S., an attractive market, especially since the adoption of the Inflation Reduction Act.  All said, two thirds of RWEs EBITDA will come from wind and solar in the medium term. That means a derisked profile with more earnings and free cash flow visibility.","We believe pro forma RWE does not deserve a moat. RWE's competitive advantages across its suite of businesses have heavily deteriorated since 2011 because of changes in energy markets and public policy, primarily for its fossil fuel and nuclear generation fleet. The collapse in generation earnings led to RWE's decision in 2016 to offer to the public a 23% stake in Innogy, its retail supply, renewable energy, and European grid infrastructure.After the asset swap with E.On, RWE shed exposure to Innogys retail and networks activities, both nonmoaty, while keeping Innogys renewables and getting E.Ons renewables. It is a pure generation player.Its conventional generation fleet will account for around 20% of the groups 2027 EBITDA. Conventional generations profitability is commodity-driven and therefore does not deserve a moat. The renewables division will account for two thirds of the groups EBITDA in 2027. Some of the assets exhibit moaty features, as 50% have regulated or contracted cash flows for more than 10 years. However, we expect returns to come under pressure because of declining government subsidies and increasing competition for new auctions.","We assign a Medium Morningstar Uncertainty Rating to RWE. Cash flows from the company's power generation and trading segments are tied directly to European commodity markets. RWE has EUR 5.7 billion of nuclear decommissioning liabilities. RWE already accepted one deal with the government that cost it EUR 6.8 billion to offload a portion of its decommissioning liabilities, including a significant risk premium payment. The value of these future liabilities could fluctuate substantially with changes in interest rates.The increasing weight of renewables after its deal with E.On brings higher exposure to volatile wind conditions and execution risk, especially for big offshore projects.The most material ESG issues for RWE are carbon-own operations, land use, and biodiversity. Carbon-own operations issue comes from the CO2 emissions from thermal plants which account for 64% of 2020 total power generation volumes of which 34% is from coal. With a carbon intensity of its conventional generation fleet (excluding renewables) of 0.6, RWE is well above its peers' average. Nonetheless, the withdrawal of lignite and coal plants will improve its carbon footprint. In the meantime, RWE claims to be financially hedged against CO2 prices until 2030.Land, use, and biodiversity issues pertain to the need for RWE to handle and finance the agricultural and forestry recultivation of open-cast lignite mines after their closures. Most of the incremental costs linked to the advanced closures of these mines due to the coal exit by 2030 are supposed to be compensated by the German government. This compensation has yet to be approved by the European Commission. ","We assign an Exemplary Morningstar Capital Allocation Rating to RWE chiefly thanks to the sound balance sheet that materially affects the Capital Allocation Rating under our methodology. The sound balance sheet is fueled by the low leverage with an economic net debt/core EBITDA of 0.6 and net debt/EV below 10%. This reflects managements admirable job of cutting debt and protecting RWE's investment-grade credit rating. We view investments as exceptional. We think management's move to create Innogy in 2016 and publicly offer a partial stake was smart and well timed. Innogy's EUR 36 per share initial offer price was at the top end of management's target range and valued the firm at EUR 20 billion, making it one of the largest European utilities. Under a large asset swap with E.On announced in early 2018, RWE agreed to sell its stake in Innogy to the former while retaining Innogys renewables business and receiving E.On's renewables division as well as a 16.7% stake in E.On. The rationale is stronger for RWE, which doubled its renewable capacity, became the third-largest renewable player in Europe and second-largest in offshore wind, and shed exposure to retail and distribution activities, whose fundamentals and outlook are unappealing to us.We view the shareholder distribution as appropriate. The decision to return to shareholders one third of its EUR 1.7 billion nuclear fuel tax refund through a special dividend in 2017 was a sign of management's commitment to shareholders. Likewise, the decision to grow the dividend annually by 5%-10%, which was announced in November 2023 versus a flat dividend planned previously, is positive. Still, we would have preferred to see a share buyback after two years of outstanding earnings. ","Since the deal with E.On, RWE is refocused on power generation, mostly in Europe. It owns 38 gigawatts of power generation capacity: 28% from lignite and hard coal plants, 37% from gas plants, 40% from renewables including pumped storage and batteries. Besides Germany, RWEs power plants are chiefly located in the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Turkey, and the United States for many onshore wind farms.","At end-2022, RWE had net financial assets of EUR 8.6 billion. Including nuclear, wind farm decommissioning, and pension provisions, the group posted an economic net cash position of EUR 1.6 billion. In 2023, we expect the economic net debt to rise to EUR 6 billion mostly because of the EUR 6.3 billion acquisition of Consolidated Edison's clean energy business. We foresee that the economic net debt will grow to EUR 12 billion in 2027 as operating cash flows will be too low to fund high renewables investments. This involves a 2027 economic net debt/core adjusted EBITDA ratio of 2 times, comfortably below the groups upper ceiling of 3. We expect the dividend to stay flat at EUR 1 between 2023 and 2027 as we believe the company will continue to prioritize renewable investments over shareholders' remuneration. On the bottom line, we see the S&Ps BBB+ credit rating as safe."
4,22/02/2024,Early Signs of Margin Recovery Bode Well for Collins Foods ,Collins Foods Ltd,CKF,4,21/12/2023,Johannes Faul,10.67,AUD,22/02/2024,14.4,High,None,Standard,,21/12/2023,"E-commerce platforms have been outperforming physical stores recently. Transaction data from National Australia Bank suggests online retail sales in October lifted 10% on last year, while total retail trade was up only 1%, as reported by the Australian Bureau of Statistics. Kicking off fiscal 2024, the multibillion-dollar online channels of Australias largest supermarkets are growing significantly faster than in-store sales. But online is also stronger than brick-and-mortar at discretionary retailers like discount department store Big W and no-moat-rated Super Retail Group. We think this speaks to a resumption of the structural shift toward e-commerce, which temporarily stalled when shops reopened after the pandemic. We expect online penetration of Australian retail sales to increase by around 0.5% per year over the next decade. This would see e-commerce accounting for around 18% of all retail sales by 2033, up from 13% in fiscal 2023. As this structural shift marches on, retailers with greater online exposure should take market share. No-moat Kogan, the cheapest retail name we cover, is well-placed to benefit. Amazons Australian expansion is a significant part of the online migration story. The e-commerce goliath is quickly expanding its local fulfillment capacity. We estimate its new mega warehouse in Melbourne will add AUD 3 billion in sales capacity, or 9% of nongrocery e-commerce. The consumer electronics category looks most exposed, including omnichannel retailers no-moat Harvey Norman and no-moat JB Hi-Fi.","The KFC brand is relatively underpenetrated in mainland Europe. There is potential for Collins Foods to both grow its existing European operations and to expand into other countries. Under guidance from Yum, management could revive its ailing Taco Bell business. In the U.S., Taco Bell operates at higher margins than KFC, offering upside if a turnaround is achieved in Australia. Further consolidation of the Australian KFC market should grow earnings. ","Organic growth potential for the core Australia business, over and above population growth, is capped by the relative maturity of the KFC brand in Australia. In the Netherlands, store rollout targets outlined in Collins Foods franchise agreements are ambitious and may prove challenging. After absorbing cost pressures to capture market share, a recovery in gross margins once inflation eases could come at the expense of top line growth.",28/11/2023,"We think the success of its Australian KFC network will prove crucial for Collins Foods. Despite KFC expansion into Europe and the nascent roll out of Taco Bell stores in Australia, we expect Collins' Australian KFC network will continue to drive the vast majority of operating earnings over the next decade. Collins is the largest KFC franchisee in Australia with over 270 restaurants out of a total of around 730 stores in the country. Its long-term earnings growth is mainly dependent on increasing sales, by increasing same store sales and adding to its store network. Collins grows its network through both new builds and acquisitions of existing restaurants from other franchisees. Similar drivers underpin growth of the smaller European business, although we forecast new builds to play a more important role. Most recently, the KFC brand has prioritized sales volumes and market share over profit margins. In both Australia and Europe, Collins has strengthened its value proposition to customers by raising menu pricing less than cost inflation. Collins delivery channel is experiencing strong growth. While the channel has added sales and profits in absolute terms, online sales are slightly dilutive to operating profit margins. In the medium term, continued strong growth in online could risk cannibalizing higher margin drive-through and carry-out sales. As a franchisee, Collins relies on agreements with Yum Brands to operate KFC and Taco Bell restaurants. In return, Yum receives royalty payments and mandates store rollout targets for Collins. These targets, typically extending over a period of five to 10 years, partially underpin Collins growth outlook and our valuation. In Australia, we expect Collins to achieve its development target of 55 new KFC restaurants by fiscal 2028. However, we are less optimistic on the outlook for its underperforming Taco Bell network. The rollout of the Taco Bell brand in Australia has been suspended, and we expect Collins to ultimately exit the brand. ","Collins Foods lacks an economic moat. Switching costs are nonexistent for restaurant patrons, and barriers to entry are relatively low, making it difficult for restaurant operators to carve out an economic moat. Restaurant operators generally source moats from either intangible assets or cost advantages, but we think Collins lacks maintainable competitive advantages stemming from brand equity or from the scale of its operations.Collins is the largest KFC franchisee in the core Australian marketaccounting for over 80% of group EBITDAbut the brand equity remains with its franchisor, wide-moat Yum Brands. As a franchisee, Collins in subject to meeting its obligations to Yum, including the rollout of net new stores. As the franchisor, Yum has the ability to set royalty rates and development goals. These are set at the store level, with each individual franchisee agreement term on average lasting 10 years with an option to extent by a further 10 years. We estimate over 40% of Collins KFC restaurants have agreements dating back more than a decade. Relationships between franchisees and franchisors are generally structured as a profit-sharing agreement, but the balance of power largely lies with the owner of the franchise.Gross profit margins are effectively set by Yum, which procures the ingredients for KFCs Australian restaurantsincluding chicken, potato fries, and cooking oiland generally sets national product prices. This allows an even playing field for all KFC franchisee restaurants at the gross profit line. We expect Yum to decide whether it passes buying efficiency on to franchisees to entice store rollouts, or keeps some of these cost benefits. The franchisors pricing strategy can materially affect Collins' margins and profitability. For instance, in fiscal 2023, Yum lifted Australian KFC prices by less than cost inflation to improve KFCs competitive position relative to other quick service restaurant chains. Collins gross profit margin fell by more than 200 basis points to 50%, and EBITDA from the Australian KFC segment dropped by 5% despite a mid-single-digit increase in same-store sales growth. We expect competition among Australias top QSR chains to remain intense in the long term, and KFC could be forced to sacrifice market share to repair its gross profit margins. In July 2023, industry leader McDonald's Australia announced a AUD 1 billion restaurant rollout and refurbishment program.KFC is the second-largest QSR chain in Australia. The network is significantly smaller than McDonalds, but bigger than Hungry Jacks and Dominos Pizza. According to Euromonitor and measured on 2022 network sales, McDonalds had a 22% share in the Australian QSR market, KFC 11%, Hungry Jacks 7%, and the Dominos Pizzas share was 6%.In the much smaller Dutch market, Collins has signed a corporate franchise agreement with Yum. This gives Collins more control of the local KFC strategy. The agreement allows Collins to develop, manage, market, support and operate the KFC business in the Netherlands, including the introduction, management, and oversight of other Dutch franchisees. However, we expect only immaterial economic benefits from this agreement, lifting midcycle group EBITDA margins by a mere 40 basis points.While we think Collins has some scale advantages compared with other Australian KFC operators, they are limited to fractionalizing overhead costs. At the restaurant level, adding incremental restaurants doesnt improve unit economics. We estimate the fractionalization of overheads explains most of the profitability gap between Collins Australian segment, and the second-largest Australian franchisee, Restaurant Brands New Zealand. We estimate underlying EBITDA margins are some 200 points greater than Restaurant Brands Australian KFC operations where its sales base is only 25% of Collins. Competition between individual KFC restaurants is limited because of their distance to one another. Instead, KFCs are in direct competition with other QSRs, full service restaurants, and food retailers. ","We assign Collins Foods a Morningstar Uncertainty Rating of High. As a restaurant operator, Collins is leveraged to the economic cycle, as consumers can always choose to eat at home when disposable income is squeezed. However, this risk is partly offset by the relatively low price point helping KFC to attract some customers, because households tend to trade down during tough times.There is a nonnegligible risk that Collins fails to meet its store rollout targets, including in the Netherlands. If Collins falls short of its Netherlands rollout target, its corporate franchise agreement could be jeopardized, and it may not earn incentive payments from Yum. However, incentive payments are an immaterial contribution to our midcycle group EBITDA margin assumptionand hence are immaterial to our valuation. Beside the impacts on Collins agreement with Yum, lower sales and earnings due to a smaller midcycle store network presents an additional risk.The main environmental, social, and governance, or ESG, issues for quick service restaurant operators like Collins are food safety risks. Food safety breaches can be widely reported in the media, and an incident in any KFC store, even those that are not operated by Collins, could damage the brands reputation and image. To manage this, Collins implemented operates internal food safety and sanitation practices, audit programs, customer complaint processes, as well as selection and communication protocols for its suppliers. We believe this mitigates the risk within Collins control to an appropriate level and we think the risk of material value destruction from ESG issues is low. ","We allocate Collins Foods a Standard Capital Allocation Rating. We rate investment efficacy as fair, distributions to shareholders as appropriate, and the balance sheet as sound.Collins investment efficacy is diminished by a recent tendency to overpay for acquisitions. In fiscal 2021 and 2022, we calculate that most restaurants acquired by Collins have been bought at a price/EBITDA greater than its own. This ratio, which we use as a proxy for the store-level payback period measured in years, averaged around 24 in the two years to fiscal 2022. This is firmly above the average multiple of global QSR industry transaction of around 9, and stands in even starker contrast Yum Brands, which targets a payback period of less than five years for its corporate stores in the U.S. Factoring in corporate overheads, we find that Collins internal rate of return on some acquired restaurants in recent years has been only slightly above Collins estimated weighted average cost of capital.The decision to reintroduce Taco Bell into Australia has led to value destruction to date, albeit to a limited extent. Before its reintroduction in 2017, Taco Bell had unsuccessfully attempted to expand into Australia in 1981 and 1997. In its third attempt, the brand again failed to gain traction, resulting in a full impairment of Collins Taco Bell stores in fiscal 2023.Collins balance sheet is sound. Although the business is cyclical, its position as a ""value"" restaurateur provides a degree of insulation from economic downturns. Collins borrowing facility is subject to a restriction on net leverage, defined as net debt/EBTIDA and is capped at 2.75. With a leverage ratio of around 1.1 in the first half of fiscal 2024, the company has significant headroom, and we expect this to persist over the next decade.We view distributions to shareholders as appropriate, with Collins historically paying out around 60% of its underlying earnings as dividends. We expect that this to continue, while providing the company with the financial flexibility for opportunistic bolt-on acquisitions.","Collins Foods is an operator of quick service restaurants, or QSRs. It franchises restaurant brands from U.S.-listed Yum Brands, including KFC in Australia, Germany, and the Netherlands, as well as Taco Bell in Australia. Most of its revenue and earnings are generated in Australia, where Collins is the largest franchisee of KFC, ahead of Restaurant Brands New Zealand.In the Netherlands, Collins has signed a corporate franchise agreement, giving it more control over development and oversight of the Dutch franchisee network.Earnings growth is underpinned by its store network expansion, both new restaurants and acquisitions of existing sites. Competitive pricing is key to maintaining share in the QSR market, and the company has generally increased at or below consumer price index growth. ","Collins Foods has the financial capacity to fund its store rollout program and pursue acquisition opportunities. Net leverage, defined as net debt/EBITDA pre-AASB16, was 1.1 in October 2023, significantly below the debt covenant restriction of 2.75. We expect this ratio to remain comfortably below the restriction over the next decade.A potential exit of Taco Bell is an immaterial risk to the financial health of Collins. We estimate the simultaneous closure of all Taco Bell restaurants would cost Collins less than AUD 30 millionnegligible in comparison to the companys intrinsic valuation and liquidity position. We assume a closure cost of about AUD 1 million per restaurantcomparable to recent closure costs reported by Restaurant Brands New Zealand (a Taco Bell franchisee in NSW in 2022) and Dominos Pizza (exiting the Danish market in 2023)."
5,22/02/2024,China Gas Holdings Lowered Guidance for Fiscal 2024; Shares Undervalued,China Gas Holdings Ltd,00384,5,28/11/2023,Chokwai Lee,7.0,HKD,21/02/2024,12.6,High,Narrow,Standard,,28/11/2023,"China Gas Holdings, or CGHs, first-half fiscal 2024 (ending March) net profit was down 44% year on year to HKD 1.8 billion. Stripping out other losses of HKD 538 million, this is largely in line with our expectations. After fine-tuning our earnings forecasts, we keep our fair value estimate of HKD 12.60. While the shares remain attractive, we think CGH needs to deliver consistent results improvement before it deserves a rerating. CGH has lowered guidance for a few segments, but this is not surprising and is similar to peers ENN Energy and China Resources Gas, or CRG. That said, it is clear that the dollar margin recovery for gas utilities is on track and this should continue to support earnings growth. We think the city gas sector is undervalued currently and our preferred pick is ENN Energy given the firms share buyback plan and potential in the integrated energy and value-added businesses. We believe key positives are the significant improvement in cash flow and a higher interim dividend. Operating cash flow surged by 60% year on year to HKD 7.6 billion due to better working capital management. As a result, CGH raised the interim dividend by 50% to HKD 0.15 per share and reduced total borrowings by HKD 3.2 billion from a year ago, striking a balance between rewarding shareholders and improving the firms balance sheet. CGH cut fiscal 2024 dollar margin guidance to CNY 0.52 per cubic meter from CNY 0.56, but this is similar to ENNs 2023 target of between CNY 0.50 and CNY 0.51, and CRGs CNY 0.50. Overall, although the implementation of cost pass-through for gas utilities is relatively slow, the worst is over for dollar margin, and it will likely improve further in the next financial year with more pass-through achieved. CGH expects 90% of cities in China will complete cost pass-through by end of 2024. Furthermore, the firm is unlikely to experience gas shortages during this winter as CGH has already contracted 98% of its forecast gas demand for fiscal 2024.","CGH is the main beneficiary of supportive policies from the government, which will encourage the usage of cleaner energy such as natural gas. The impending spinoff of the value-added services segment should improve the firms balance sheet. Rising utilization rate of the LPG segment could potentially help to expand margins and contribute to earnings growth.",The Shiyan gas accident has negatively affected CGHs city gas operation and the firm will grow more slowly than peers. The delay in CGHs LPG smart microgrid projects will affect CGHs earnings growth in the future as a result of fewer new residential connections. Volatile oil prices may disrupt the firms LPG operations and reduce earnings.,28/11/2023,"China Gas Holdings, or CGH, is involved in the wholesale and retail businesses of natural gas and liquefied petroleum gas, or LPG, in China. Benefiting from its exclusive city gas concession rights and efficient scale, the firm has been able to generate returns above its cost of capital, and we expect this to continue over the next decade, supporting our narrow moat rating for CGH. In the past, CGH aggressively expanded into rural city gas projects, resulting in a relatively stretched balance sheet compared with its peers. The firm now focuses on the asset-light value-added services business, as well as development of the urban heating business. We believe the government remains committed to boosting the use of natural gas to ease pollution issues, and CGH should be one of the main beneficiaries. We project CGHs retail natural gas sales volume will grow at a 5.6% CAGR during fiscal 2023-28. In our view, a market-oriented reform of natural gas pricing in the long run will lead to stable growth for city gas operators such as CGH. Meanwhile, the turnaround in CGHs LPG business could be a potential earnings catalyst on the back of rising demand and increasing utilization of its infrastructure. On the other hand, we anticipate the value-added services segment (such as sales of insurance and appliances) to maintain decent earnings growth, as it would benefit from abundant cross-selling opportunities, taking advantage of the groups customer base of more than 50 million. CGH has also ventured into new businesses such as distributed urban heating and LPG smart microgrid, and we think these will be a longer-term growth story.","We believe CGH has a narrow economic moat, based on its city gas operations in China. Service-territory monopolies and efficient-scale advantages are the primary moat sources for regulated utilities such as CGH. We are confident CGH will earn more than its cost of capital at least for the next decade, supporting our narrow moat rating.CGH owns exclusive concessions to invest, build, and connect city gas pipelines and supply natural gas to industrial, commercial, and residential customers. These concessions typically last for 30 years. The firm derives revenue from its city gas operations by charging users one-off connection fees and gas usage fees. Different tariffs are applied to residential, industrial, and commercial users, which allow the firm to earn a fair return on the capital it invests to build, operate, and maintain the distribution networks. Residential tariffs proposed by CGH will need to be approved by the provincial/local pricing bureaus, while tariffs for industrial and commercial users are benchmarked to indicative prices set by the local pricing bureaus. Currently, tariffs for residential users are lower than industrial and commercial users. City gas operators are cautious about setting their tariffs too high due to public scrutiny, which may in turn trigger stricter regulations from the government. CGHs tariff-setting is transparent, as the costs of gas prices are disclosed to local pricing bureaus. Any changes in costs of gas prices would eventually pass through to end users, albeit sometimes with delays. The government allows gas distributors to achieve a return on assets, or ROA, of up to 7% on their city gas operations, excluding earnings from connection fees. We understand that ROA for most of CGHs city gas projects are still below 7%, so we dont see near-term risk for the firm to reduce its tariffs.In addition to its exclusive rights, we think barriers to entry are very high for new entrants, as they lack the scale CGH enjoys. CGH owns 551,688 kilometers (as of end-March 2023) of pipeline network in China, and it is unlikely that a new entrant would have incentive to sink in a huge amount of capital to build such pipelines without being sure that it will obtain fair compensation. Furthermore, given that the gas pipelines have already been installed in residences, it will be inconvenient for residential users to switch to other alternatives such as LPG, unless they are priced substantially cheaper.CGH is also the largest distributor of LPG in China via wholesale and retail channels, and it uses its own receiving, storage, and distribution infrastructure. That said, we refrain from assigning a moat to this segment, given its commodified nature and cyclical raw material prices. A sudden surge in LPG prices that results in higher purchase costs for CGH could drag the returns of this segment below its overall cost of capital, in our view. For example, the business was loss-making in fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2013, and we saw operating margin stayed below 3% during fiscal 2019-23.CGH is developing its value-added services business, which includes sales of gas-related appliances and insurance products. While we believe the firm can experience solid growth for this business by tapping its current customers, we dont expect it to have a moat given the commodified nature of these products and the relatively small scale.We believe potential regulations, such as the removal of connection fees and the introduction of a regulated market with lower allowed returns, are long-term risks to city gas operators in China. These preclude CGH from attaining a wide economic moat.Material environmental, social, and governance, or ESG, exposures also create additional risks for gas utilities, especially product governance, which relates both to the quality of service provided to customers as well as service safety. For example, an accident resulting from pipeline explosion can result in property damage, fatalities, and fines. In June 2021, a gas explosion incident occurred in Shiyan City, Hubei Province, which caused the death of 26 people, and CGH is a gas supplier for the area. In addition to penalties, the firm has to allocate more resources to focus on strengthening safety management instead of market development, which resulted in slower new residential connections growth in fiscal 2022 (ending March). That said, unless there are repeated incidents, we believe CGHs narrow moat rating is still intact despite the Shiyan accident.","We have a high uncertainty rating for CGH. In more mature markets, a regulated utility like CGH should carry a low or medium uncertainty rating, but given that Chinas city gas industry is still growing rapidly, uncertainty is heightened by earnings sensitivity to growth assumptions.The firm's biggest risk is potential regulatory change. There are concerns that the government will stop city gas operators from charging natural gas users one-off connection fees. Given that connection fees and related engineering design and construction business together contribute more than 20% of CGHs earnings in fiscal 2023, if this were to occur, it could be disastrous for the firm. Nonetheless, given that penetration of city gas in China is still relatively low, we think the government is unlikely to do this, as it discourages investment in the sector. In the longer term, the importance of connection fees is likely to decline as more city gas projects mature and start contributing stable cash flows. Similarly, although the government can introduce caps to the revenue/earnings of city gas operators, we think tariffs will still be set at a level that can incentivize further investment from city gas operators.A shortage of gas supply or higher energy costs will negatively affect the firms dollar margin, but we think the firm should be able to mitigate it by gradually passing through the higher costs and diversifying its gas sources.Meanwhile, the firms LPG operation may introduce additional risk to its earnings, given that it is a commodified business and is subject to cyclical product price cycles.We think CGH's key ESG risk (captured in our uncertainty rating) is product governance, given the firms long gas pipeline network, which exposes CGH to risks related to employee and public safety. Insufficient maintenance and management of gas pipelines can cause accidents such as explosions, which can result in fatalities, fines, and operational disruptions.","We rate CGH's Capital Allocation actions as Standard. CGH is led by executive chairman Liu Ming Hui. Liu is the founder of the firm, and he owns about 19.7% of the total issued shares of the company. On the other hand, state-owned Beijing Enterprises Group also holds a 22.1% stake in the company. We think CGH benefits from its connection with state-owned enterprise while at the same time can make flexible and efficient investment decisions.Management has done a good job in the past of expanding its natural gas business, which saw a more than 40% CAGR in sales volume during fiscal 2004-23. Nonetheless, we have seen comparable impressive growth from other peers as well. Meanwhile, the decision to venture into the LPG business in 2008 was a mixed bag, with the division achieving low returns or making losses before turning around in fiscal 2014. However, segment returns remain volatile, and margin fell to 0.8% in fiscal 2019 from a high of 4.7% in fiscal 2017. We saw margin still stayed below 3% during fiscal 2020-23 and we will need to see consistent improvement in this segment's returns to support managements view that the investment is a sound strategy.Over the years, management is being more shareholder-friendly and is gradually increasing its dividend payout ratio to above 40% from below 20%. We believe that a higher payout is possible in the longer run, when the firms city gas operations become more mature. However, given that the firm is still in expansion mode, we expect the firm to increase its dividend payout ratio at a measured pace. The net gearing ratio for the group is at 0.85 times as at the end of fiscal 2023, deteriorated from 0.72 times as at fiscal 2022.At the moment, CGH is continuing to reinvest the bulk of its capital into new projects. In the past, CGH aggressively expanded into rural city gas projects, resulting in a relatively stretched balance sheet compared with its peers. The firm now focuses on the asset-light value-added services business, as well as development of the urban heating business. While it is still too early to comment on the long-term profitability of these initiatives, we will monitor this closely to evaluate managements strategy.","China Gas Holdings is involved in the wholesale and retail businesses of natural gas and liquefied petroleum gas in China. As of fiscal 2023 (ended March 31, 2023), the group had secured a total of 661 piped gas concessions, 533 compressed natural gas/liquefied natural gas refilling stations for vehicles, and 106 LPG distribution projects in China. In total, CGH has connected 45.4 million residential households and achieved a penetration rate of 68.6%.","CGHs balance sheet is slightly stretched, with net debt/EBITDA of 4.6 times and EBITDA interest coverage of 5.8 times at the end of fiscal 2023. The firm suffered from an exchange loss of HKD 513.2 million in fiscal 2016 due to the depreciation of the Chinese yuan. In order to lower its foreign exchange risk, CGH has reduced the proportion of foreign currency debt to 26.1% of total debt at the end of fiscal 2023 from 83.0% at the end of fiscal 2015. The net gearing ratio for the group was 0.85 times as at the end of fiscal 2023. In the longer term, the firm targets to lower its gearing gradually, while increasing its dividend payout ratio. This is within our expectations, as we think CGH will be able to cover its capital expenditures through its operating cash flows, excluding opportunistic acquisitions."

If local governments decide to introduce lower allowed returns to city gas operators, CRGs valuation will decline sharply. CRGs dollar margin will be negatively affected by high energy prices.",28/08/2023,"China Resources Gas Group is a state-owned gas utilities group in China engaging in downstream city gas distribution. We expect CRG to generate returns above its cost of capital over the next decade, supporting our narrow-moat rating. Chinas goal to increase gas usage to 15% of the countrys energy sources by 2030 will continue to encourage long-term demand growth, in our view. We project CRGs natural gas sales volume to grow at a 7.3% CAGR during 2022-27. In addition, we think the launches of the natural gas exchanges in Chongqing and Shanghai and the gradual opening of gas pipelines to third-party access through the establishment of China Oil & Gas Pipeline Network Corporation should lead to a market-oriented reform of natural gas pricing and promote healthy growth for city gas operators. As one of the largest city gas operators in China by gas sales volume, CRG can leverage its leading position to source for cheaper gas, in our opinion. Furthermore, the firms joint venture investment in the Rudong LNG terminal project (to be completed in 2024) should help CRG to better secure gas sources and improve market competitiveness in the longer term. We see strong growth potential for its comprehensive service businesses such as sales of gas appliances, gas insurance and personalized installation, given the firms large customer base and low penetration rate. CRG is also venturing into other businesses to develop new clean energy supply to meet the diversified energy demand of its customers and diversify its earnings. The firms electricity charging business has 171 stations in operations in 2022. In addition, the firm has seven hydrogen refueling stations in operations in 2022, with more projects in the pipeline. Nevertheless, we do not expect meaningful contributions from these new ventures in the near term given their relatively small scales.","CRG deserves a narrow moat rating, in our view, with intangible assets and efficient scale the key sources of its competitive advantages. We believe CRG will earn more than its cost of capital at least for the next decade, and specific factors affecting long-term returns and our narrow-moat recommendation include the following key items.First, CRG owns exclusive rights on its city gas operations, and these concessions typically last for 30 years. The firm derives revenue from its city gas operations by charging users one-off connection fees and ongoing gas usage fees. Different tariffs are applied to residential, industrial, and commercial customers, which allow the firm to earn a fair return on the capital it invests to build, operate, and maintain the distribution networks. Residential tariffs proposed by CRG will need to be approved by the provincial/local pricing bureaus, while tariffs for industrial and commercial users are benchmarked to indicative prices set by the local pricing bureaus. Currently, tariffs for residential users are lower than those for industrial and commercial users. City gas operators are cautious about setting their tariffs too high due to public scrutiny, which may in turn trigger stricter regulations from the government. CRGs tariff-setting is transparent, given that gas procurement costs are disclosed to local pricing bureaus. Any changes in costs of gas prices would eventually pass through to end users albeit sometimes with delays. The government allows gas distributors to achieve a return on assets, or ROA, of up to 7% on their city gas operations, excluding earnings from connection fees. We understand that ROA for most of CRGs city gas projects is still below 7%, so we dont see near-term risk for the firm to reduce its tariffs.Second, we think barriers to entry are very high for new entrants, as they lack the scale that CRG enjoys. The firms 291,605 kilometers of pipeline network in China as at the end of 2022 constitute a ""moaty"" asset, as the challenges of constructing a competing pipeline confer near-monopoly status on city gas operators. It is unlikely that a new entrant would have incentive to sink in a huge amount of capital to build such pipelines without being sure that it can obtain payback.Third, given that the gas pipelines have already been installed in the residences, it will be inconvenient for residential users to switch to other alternatives such as liquefied petroleum gas unless they are substantially cheaper.CRG is keen on expanding its business beyond its city gas operations. For example, it is growing its integrated services business, which includes sales of gas appliances and insurance products. While we believe the firm can experience solid growth for this business by tapping its current customers, we dont expect it to have a moat given the commodified nature of these products and the relatively small scale. CRG also has other businesses such as electricity charging stations and hydrogen refueling stations. As these businesses are still in their infancy stages, they do not affect our moat recommendation, in our opinion.We believe potential regulations, such as the removal of connection fees and the introduction of a regulated market with lower allowed returns, are long-term risks to city gas operators in China. These preclude CRG from attaining a wide economic moat.","We have a Morningstar Uncertainty Rating of High for China Resources Gas. Based on CRGs earnings sensitivity to various growth assumptions, and the range of return outcomes used by our star rating system, we believe a High Uncertainty Rating is most appropriate.The firm's biggest risk is potential regulatory change. There are concerns that the government will stop city gas operators from charging natural gas users one-off connection fees. However, we think it is unlikely that the government will do so as it discourages investment in the sector. In the longer term, the importance of connection fees is likely to decline as more city gas projects mature and start contributing stable cash flows. Similarly, although the government can introduce caps to the revenue/earnings of city gas operators, we think that tariffs will still be set at a level that can encourage further investment by city gas operators.A shortage of gas supply or higher energy costs will negatively affect the firms dollar margin, but we think the firm should be able to mitigate it by gradually passing through the higher costs and diversifying its gas sources.We think CRG's key potential ESG risks (captured in our Uncertainty Rating) include product governance, occupational health and safety, and corporate governance. Of these, we think product governance has a higher chance of occurring, given the firms long gas pipeline network, which exposes CRG to risks related to employee and public safety. Insufficient maintenance and management of gas pipelines can cause accidents such as explosions, which can result in fatalities, fines, and operational disruptions. In June 2021, a gas explosion incident occurred in Shiyan City, Hubei Province, and China Gas Holdings is a piped gas supplier for the area. We believe this incident has resulted in more stringent examinations on gas utilities operations, such as to tighten safety checks and replace old pipelines.","We rate CRG's capital allocation actions as Standard. Although management has expanded CRG from a relatively small company that owned seven city gas projects in 2008 to a company with 273 concessions in 2022, we have seen similar results achieved by peers. We believe the firms decision to venture into new businesses such as electricity charging posts and hydrogen refueling stations will be an opportunity for investors to assess managements capabilities in capital allocation.CRG is 61.5% owned by state-owned China Resources Company. Given the state-owned background, we feel that the firms development strategy is relatively conservative compared with peers, which may result in loss of business opportunities. That said, this may not be a bad thing entirely as CRG also has a more stable earnings profile.CRGs balance sheet is solid given its strong operating cash flow. The firm has been increasing its dividend payout ratio to 50% in 2022 from 30% in 2016, which we think is a right move to reward shareholders. We forecast dividend payout ratio to remain at 50% in the long run as the city gas operations have entered into a more mature phase.","China Resources Gas Group is a leading gas utilities group in China engaged in city gas distribution, including piped natural gas distribution and natural gas filling stations. At the end of 2022, CRGs portfolio comprised 273 city gas projects in China. The firm achieved annual gas sales volume of 35.9 billion cubic meters and has connected 53.9 million residential customers, or a penetration rate of 58.2%.","CRGs balance sheet is solid with adjusted EBITDA interest coverage of 22 times in 2022 and net gearing ratio of 29% as at end-2022. We expect the firms financial position to remain healthy in the future due to its strong operating cash flow. Although the firm remains active in making acquisitions and expanding into new businesses, we believe its operating cash flow should be able to support its capital expenditures. CRGs dividend payout ratio stood at 50% in 2022."
7,22/02/2024,ENN Energy Looks Undervalued Following Recent Pullback,ENN Energy Holdings Ltd,02688,5,28/11/2023,Chokwai Lee,61.2,HKD,21/02/2024,102.0,High,Narrow,Standard,,28/11/2023,"China Gas Holdings, or CGHs, first-half fiscal 2024 (ending March) net profit was down 44% year on year to HKD 1.8 billion. Stripping out other losses of HKD 538 million, this is largely in line with our expectations. After fine-tuning our earnings forecasts, we keep our fair value estimate of HKD 12.60. While the shares remain attractive, we think CGH needs to deliver consistent results improvement before it deserves a rerating. CGH has lowered guidance for a few segments, but this is not surprising and is similar to peers ENN Energy and China Resources Gas, or CRG. That said, it is clear that the dollar margin recovery for gas utilities is on track and this should continue to support earnings growth. We think the city gas sector is undervalued currently and our preferred pick is ENN Energy given the firms share buyback plan and potential in the integrated energy and value-added businesses. We believe key positives are the significant improvement in cash flow and a higher interim dividend. Operating cash flow surged by 60% year on year to HKD 7.6 billion due to better working capital management. As a result, CGH raised the interim dividend by 50% to HKD 0.15 per share and reduced total borrowings by HKD 3.2 billion from a year ago, striking a balance between rewarding shareholders and improving the firms balance sheet. CGH cut fiscal 2024 dollar margin guidance to CNY 0.52 per cubic meter from CNY 0.56, but this is similar to ENNs 2023 target of between CNY 0.50 and CNY 0.51, and CRGs CNY 0.50. Overall, although the implementation of cost pass-through for gas utilities is relatively slow, the worst is over for dollar margin, and it will likely improve further in the next financial year with more pass-through achieved. CGH expects 90% of cities in China will complete cost pass-through by end of 2024. Furthermore, the firm is unlikely to experience gas shortages during this winter as CGH has already contracted 98% of its forecast gas demand for fiscal 2024.","Chinas policies to encourage the use of cleaner energy, such as natural gas, will continue to benefit leading city gas operators such as ENN. Rising contributions from integrated energy and value-added businesses will underpin ENNs future earnings growth. ENN will be able to leverage its parents LNG receiving terminal to secure stable gas source at competitive prices.","ENNs profitability will be negatively affected by the potential removal of the one-off connection fees from its city gas operations. If local governments decide to introduce lower allowed returns to city gas operators, ENNs valuation will decline sharply. ENNs city gas operations will be affected by rising energy costs.",30/10/2023,"ENN Energy Holdings is a privately owned gas utility company in China engaged primarily in distributing and retailing natural gas. We are confident that ENN will generate returns above its cost of capital over the next decade, supporting our narrow moat rating. We believe Chinas goal to reduce pollution by increasing gas usage to 15% of the countrys energy sources by 2030, from below 10% in 2020, will maintain long-term demand growth for gas. Furthermore, the government remains committed to market-oriented reform of natural gas pricing, which should promote natural gas consumption. We think the launches of the natural gas exchanges in Chongqing and Shanghai and the gradual opening of gas pipelines to third-party access through the establishment of China Oil & Gas Pipeline Network Corporation will help to accomplish this. We therefore estimate ENNs retail natural gas sales volume to grow at a 4.0% CAGR during 2022-27. Meanwhile, the firms parent company, ENN Natural Gas, owns Chinas first privately owned liquefied natural gas, or LNG, receiving terminal in Zhejiang Province. The terminal was commissioned in mid-2018, with 6 million tons of annual capacity in 2021. ENN has signed long-term gas supply deals with Chevron, Total, and Origin to purchase 1.44 million tons of LNG annually. In our view, these contracts, together with the right to access the Zhoushan terminal, can help ENN to secure its gas source at a more competitive price, and will reduce the risk of supply bottlenecks versus domestic alternatives. ENN also aims to become an integrated energy supplier to diversify its income streams. The firm is already involved in the asset-light wholesale gas business while integrated energy and value-added businesses are new engines of growth. Given the ability to capitalize on its established customer base, we see long-term potential and we anticipate integrated energy and value-added business divisions to contribute more than 30% of ENNs total gross profit in 2023.","We believe ENN has a narrow economic moat, with intangible assets and efficient scale being key sources of competitive advantages. We think ENN will earn more than its cost of capital at least for the next decade, and specific factors affecting long-term returns and our narrow-moat recommendation include the following key items.First, ENN owns exclusive rights on its city gas operations in China, and these concessions typically last for 30 years. The firm gets revenue from its city gas operations by charging users one-off connection fees and ongoing gas usage fees. Different tariffs are applied to residential, industrial, and commercial customers, which allow the firm to earn a fair return on the capital it invests to build, operate, and maintain the distribution networks. Residential tariffs proposed by ENN will need to be approved by the provincial/local pricing bureaus, while tariffs for industrial and commercial users are benchmarked to indicative prices set by the local pricing bureaus. Currently, tariffs for residential users are lower than those for industrial and commercial users. City gas operators are cautious about setting their tariffs too high because of public scrutiny, which may in turn trigger stricter regulations from the government. ENNs tariff setting is transparent, given that gas procurement costs are disclosed to the local pricing bureaus. Any changes in costs of gas prices would eventually pass through to end users albeit sometimes with delays. The government allows gas distributors to achieve a return on assets, or ROA, of up to 7% on their city gas operations, excluding earnings from connection fees. We understand that ROA for most of ENNs city gas projects is still below 7% so we dont see near-term risk for the firm to reduce its tariffs. Second, we think barriers to entry are high for new entrants, because they lack the scale that ENN has. The firms 77,677 kilometers of pipeline network in China as at the end of 2022 is a moaty asset because the challenges of constructing a competing pipeline confer near-monopoly status on ENN. It is unlikely a new entrant would have the incentive to make a large capital investment to build such pipelines without being sure it can get a payback.Third, given the gas pipelines have already been installed in the residences, it will be inconvenient for residential users to switch to other alternatives, such as liquefied petroleum gas, unless they are substantially cheaper.ENN also aims to become an integrated energy supplier to diversify its income streams. Hence, ENN is expanding its integrated energy business, which helps customers to improve its energy efficiency (energy conservation and reduce carbon emissions). This business supplies energy products such as gas, electricity, cooling, heating and steam, by using various clean energy sources, including biomass, photovoltaic, and natural gas. We dont think this segment is moaty, because the competition is intense with no service territory monopolies, while the firm doesnt have significant advantages over its competitors such as other city gas operators, independent power producers, and power grid companies.In addition, ENN is growing its value-added business which includes sales of kitchen appliances and insurance products. While we believe the firm can experience solid growth for this business by tapping on its current customers, we dont expect it to have a moat given the commodified nature of these products and the relatively small scale. Similarly, we refrain from assigning a moat to the wholesale gas segment, given its commodified nature and the cyclical raw material prices.We believe potential regulations, such as the removal of connection fees and the introduction of a regulated market with lower allowed returns, are long-term risks to city gas operators in China. These preclude ENN from attaining a wide economic moat.","We have a Morningstar Uncertainty Rating of High for ENN Energy. Based on ENNs earnings sensitivity to various growth assumptions, and the range of return outcomes used by our star rating system, we believe a High Uncertainty Rating is most appropriate.The firm's biggest risk is potential regulatory change. There are concerns that the government will stop city gas operators from charging natural gas users one-off connection fees. However, we think it is unlikely that the government will do so as it discourages investment in the sector. In the longer term, the importance of connection fees is likely to decline as more city gas projects mature and start contributing stable cash flows. Similarly, although the government can introduce caps to the revenue/earnings of city gas operators, we think that tariffs will still be set at a level that can encourage further investment by city gas operators.A shortage of gas supply or higher energy costs will negatively affect the firms dollar margin, but we think the firm should be able to mitigate this by gradually passing through the higher costs and diversifying its gas sources.We think ENN's key potential ESG risks (captured in our Uncertainty Rating) include corporate governance and product governance. Of these, we think product governance has a higher chance of occurring, given the firms long gas pipeline network, which exposes ENN to risks related to employee and public safety. Insufficient maintenance and management of gas pipelines can cause accidents such as explosions, which can result in fatalities, fines, and operational disruptions. In June 2021, a gas explosion incident occurred in Shiyan City, Hubei Province, and China Gas Holdings is a piped gas supplier for the area. We believe this incident has resulted in more stringent examinations on gas utilities operations, such as to tighten safety checks and replace old pipelines.","We rate ENN's Capital Allocation actions as Standard. ENN is led by executive chairman Wang Yusuo, the founder of the firm. He owns about 33% of the company's outstanding shares through ENN Natural Gas. Being a privately owned gas distributor, we think the firm is more flexible and efficient in terms of making investment decisions versus its state-owned peers. The companys sales volume of natural gas has been growing at more than 40% CAGR for the past 22 years, although we have seen similar results achieved by peers.In the past, ENN has ventured into overseas such as natural gas operations in Vietnam, along with a gas refueling business in North America. However, returns from these businesses are insignificant, and the gas refueling business was loss-making. In 2018, the firm disposed of the North America gas refueling business to avoid further impact on its financial performance. That said, these investments are relatively small and overall the firm is still generating economic profit for its core business. Going forward, we think management will need to prove that it is capable of making sound investments in other businesses. The firm is diversifying into integrated energy business, which will enable us to further evaluate managements capability to expand the firm into an integrated energy supplier.ENN has a healthy balance sheet, with net gearing ratio of 0.25 times as of the end of 2022. In the past five years, the firms annual dividend payout ratio is at least 30%. However, we think there is still room for the firm to gradually increase its dividend payout ratio as the firms operating cash flow remains strong while its balance sheet is robust.","ENN Energy Holdings is primarily engaged in distributing and retailing natural gas. By year-end 2022, ENN owned 254 city gas projects in China, with annual gas sales volume of 32.7 billion cubic meters. Meanwhile, the aggregate number of connected piped gas residential households reached 27.9 million, with an average gas penetration rate of 62.9%. ENN Energy also has ventured into integrated energy business with 210 projects in operation.","ENN has a healthy balance sheet, with net debt/adjusted EBITDA of 0.7 times and adjusted EBITDA interest coverage of 20.2 times by the end of 2022. The firms net gearing ratio was 0.25 times. We expect these ratios to remain sound given the robust cash flow from its city gas operations.About 56.5% of ENNs total borrowing as at end-2022 is denominated in foreign currencies. Meanwhile, 24.6% of the firms foreign currency borrowings are hedged and ENN will keep track of exchange-rate fluctuations and take further actions to manage its risk when necessary.We also think ENN will be able to gradually increase its dividend payout ratio despite ongoing business expansion as its growing operating cash flow should be able to support its capital expenditures."
8,22/02/2024,Zscaler Is Setting Itself Up for Long-Term Success in a Competitive Security Market,Zscaler Inc,ZS,2,28/11/2023,Malik Khan,213.92,USD,21/02/2024,183.0,High,Narrow,Exemplary,B,28/11/2023,"We are maintaining our $183 fair value estimate for narrow-moat Zscaler after the firm kicked off fiscal 2024 with strong sales growth and profitability. While macroeconomic uncertainty continues to affect customer decisions, we were encouraged to see Zscalers strength in landing new business as well as expanding existing client spending. With an eye on the long term, we believe Zscaler stands to materially benefit as organizations seek cloud-native security vendors to manage their increasingly complex security needs. Further, as a security vendor that provides multiple solutions across a clients security apparatus, we think Zscaler will benefit from increased vendor consolidation as customers seek to refocus their security spending toward a smaller set of vendors. With Zscalers shares trading down after the earnings report, we view them as fairly valued. Zscalers first-quarter sales clocked in at $497 million, up 40% year over year and well ahead of managements prior guidance. Underscoring this revenue strength was a healthy mix of new sales and expanding spending from existing accounts. On the new sales front, Zscaler closed a record number of deals with an annual contract value of more than $1 million, as this customer cohort expanded 34% year over year to 468. At the same time, the firm was able to show robust execution on the upselling side as well. Net retention, a measure of additional spending by existing clients, came in at a solid 120%. On the profitability front, Zscalers adjusted operating margins for the quarter came in at 18%, above managements guidance of 15% and up more than 600 basis points year over year. We attribute this rapid expansion in margins to the firms emphasis on financial discipline during a period of macroeconomic uncertainty as well as strong revenue. We believe this indicates the leverage inherent in the companys business model and supports our long-term estimates.","Zscaler has strong secular tailwinds behind its back as the convergence of networking and the security market is in its early innings. Zscaler has market leadership and high enterprise penetration through its offerings related to secure web gateways and zero-trust network access. Consolidation of security vendors should benefit Zscaler, which has a wide array of solutions across an enterprises network security stack.","Large public cloud vendors often offer their own cybersecurity solutions, which could hamper Zscalers growth opportunities. Zscaler faces competition from vendors like Palo Alto and Fortinet that have increasingly made investments in the key areas where Zscaler has a market-leading position. There always remains a risk that Zscaler may miss out on the next big technology, thereby allowing its competitors to catch up.",06/09/2023,"We see Zscaler as a pioneer and leader in zero-trust security solutions, an area of cybersecurity primed for growth due to secular trends such as increased digitization of an enterprise and a convergence of networking and security. We have a positive outlook on Zscalers solutions as the firm stands to materially benefit from these trends. The firm has built out a narrow economic moat by developing a sticky product portfolio (as evidenced by its strong net and gross retention metrics.) Zscalers bet was that, over time, enterprises would shift their network-traffic routing from a centralized node (typically the headquarters) to a decentralized direct-to-cloud route. Zscalers two key solutions, Zscaler Internet Access and Zscaler Private Access, allow firms to directly connect to external and internal resources, respectively, without needing to route traffic through a centralized node. This shift in how network activity is routed comes at a time when an increasingly large share of enterprise workflows are cloud-based, as digital transformations and cloud migrations alter the IT makeup of enterprises. However, this change in traffic flow has also created a myriad of problems for enterprises. First, as the reliance on cloud-based resources has grown, the amount of network activity generated by these workflows has rapidly increased. Second, by decentralizing network traffic, there is a need for new security apparatuses and methods to secure the traffic. Last, this shift in network traffic is premised on a zero-trust security infrastructure that removes the risk of lateral mobility, a process in which a malicious actor gains access to one application and then uses its credentials to advance onto other applications. In this shifting landscape, we believe Zscalers solutions stand to be long-term winners. The companys products have found great enterprise demand, with Zscaler able to attract new customers and expand its customer base. While ZIA and ZPA are two key solutions, both of them consist of many individual modules that allow Zscaler to expand revenue from an existing client by either selling it more seats or increasing the usage of its solutions.","We assign Zscaler a narrow moat rating owing primarily to strong switching costs and secondarily to a network effort associated with its offerings. We believe Zscalers industry-leading zero-trust security solutions will continue to see robust enterprise adoption, allowing the firm to both retain and expand its footprint within existing organizations, while also allowing the company to land new customers. As a result, we forecast Zscaler to generate excess returns over invested capital over the next decade.As we look at the broader cybersecurity space, we believe the complexity and intensity of threats are ever-increasing. Enterprises continue to adopt SaaS solutions, undergo digital transformations, and migrate to the cloud, all while employees continue to work remotely part-time. In turn, we see the number of attack vectors (or entry points for nefarious players) rapidly growing. Similarly, the intensity of digital threats is also on the rise, with higher costs of a data breach, including punitive fines, for any customer data theft.These trends have rendered the traditional castle-and-moat version of enterprise cybersecurity obsolete. Traditionally, firewalls have stood guard outside corporate networks, inspecting traffic entering and exiting the network. However, with enterprises increasingly using cloud-based solutions (whether it be SaaS applications like Salesforce or public cloud vendors like AWS), the need for hardware firewalls to inspect network traffic is significantly reduced. Instead, enterprises have increasingly shifted to cloud-based solutions that provide a robust way to secure network activity stemming from and traveling within the cloud. In this shifting landscape, Zscalers zero-trust infrastructure allows enterprises to not only maintain a robust security posture but also eliminate areas of excessive IT spend by reducing reliance on costly hardware appliances. While the need for hardware firewalls still remains, we think that the market buying activity has heavily tilted toward cloud-based solutions such as Zscaler. We believe that the shift away from hardware firewalls is part of a broader convergence of networking and security (with Zscalers products materially benefiting from it).Zscalers solutions can be broadly portioned into two key areas: Zscaler Internet Access, or ZIA, which provides secure access to external applications (SaaS apps like Salesforce, Office 365, and so on) and Zscaler Private Access, or ZPA, which provides secure access to internally managed applications (which could include internal APIs, databases, and so on). Within each vertical, Zscaler provides a slew of modules ranging from sandboxes to application protection and browser isolation. By remaining agnostic to network, location, or device, Zscalers solutions can help enterprises create policies that secure access to both internal and external applications while being able to enact changes to these policies instantly at a companywide scale.We often see high switching costs for enterprise-focused cybersecurity vendors that often have an expansive footprint across an enterprise. To uproot such a vendor requires not only a competitive offering from another vendor, but often retraining staff to use the new set of security solutions, a period of increased vulnerability. Additionally, we believe security-related IT decisions are driven by security analysts and engineers that focus on performance, rather than price, so enterprises are unlikely to rip out cybersecurity solutions as a source of potential cost savings. Zscalers stickiness is evidenced by the firms high-90% gross retention rate and a solid net retention rate above 120%. Both metrics highlight the fact that existing customers not only keep on using Zscalers solutions but spend more on the company with the passage of time.Along with high switching costs, we believe a network effect reinforces Zscaler's economic moat. Cybersecurity, in its essence, is a data problem, and attacks are now too overwhelming to be handled manually. In turn, vendors have developed AI solutions to automate processes and pick up threats (especially never-seen-before, zero-day attacks). However, artificial intelligence and ML solutions are only as good as the data that is fed to them. This need for good-quality data is where we see vendors such as Zscaler having an edge as they have data streaming into their security solutions from across the enterprise. For some context, Zscalers security solutions monitor more than 250 billion requests each day, allowing the firm to monitor activity at a scale very few cybersecurity firms can.By collecting and analyzing this rich data coming into its platforms, a vendor such as Zscaler can uncover threats and new threat signatures that can then be used to update its entire client bases security posture. As more data comes in, Zscalers platforms become better at detecting and mitigating cyber threats. As a result, more customers opt for Zscalers solutions due to superior productswhich, in turn, leads to more data, and the flywheel spins faster. We see this network effect as reinforcing switching costs as wellwith customers hesitant to leave Zscaler as it may entail losing this shared threat-detection and response capability.","We assign Zscaler a High Morningstar Uncertainty Rating due to the firm competing in the ever-shifting cybersecurity space. While Zscaler has positioned itself well to benefit from secular tailwinds such as a shift to zero-trust security and the convergence of networking and security, the cybersecurity space is known for its rapid pace of development. With this in mind, large incumbents such as Zscaler that have performed exceptionally well in particular verticals stand to be disrupted by upstarts that could offer better performance in key modules. To stay ahead of the pack, Zscaler has invested a great deal of capital in building out its ZIA and ZPA solutions. However, a shifting demand landscape coupled with newer products that impact Zscalers competitive positioning are a risk for the firm.Much like other software firms, Zscaler invests heavily in its sales and research departments. Due to the high spending in these verticals, the firm is yet to achieve GAAP profitability. While we firmly believe in Zscalers long-term opportunity, we think that to bask in the light at the end of the tunnel, Zscaler will have to execute well in the coming years.Regarding environmental, social, and governance, or ESG, risks, we do not foresee any material ESG issues, or MEIs. However, notable potential risks include attracting and retaining talent, which could demand high remuneration amid a talent shortage in cybersecurity. Also, Zscalers solutions are tasked with protecting customers from cyberattacks, making data privacy and security a key concern.","We assign Zscaler an Exemplary Capital Allocation Rating based on its sound balance sheet, exceptional investments, and appropriate shareholder distributions.CEO and chair Jay Chaudhry has been at the helm since the companys inception. His ideas and vision have allowed the firm to carve its niche in the broader cybersecurity market, and we have no reason to doubt that his leadership will facilitate the firm achieving durable growth and profitability.We think Zscalers balance sheet is in good shape. With a strong cash and liquid investments reserve and positive cash flow margins, we are not overly concerned by the firm's use of debt. Further, we think that the stickiness of the firm's product portfolio reduces downside risk in the event of an economic downturn.Zscalers investment strategy has been stellar over the last few years. The firm wagered heavily on the convergence of networking and security by investing significant capital in building out products that service the needs of enterprises as they reduce their reliance on hardware firewalls. The firms two main product segments, ZIA and ZPA, both have found customer appetite, and the firms investments in organically developing these solutions will reap rewards in the coming years.Since Zscaler has been aggressively expanding its business, the company does not pay its shareholders a dividend and has no plans on starting one soon. We see this strategy as appropriate given the firms potential growth prospects across network security.","Zscaler is a software-as-a-service, or SaaS, firm focusing on providing cloud-native cybersecurity solutions to primarily enterprise customers. Zscalers offerings can be broadly partitioned into Zscaler Internet Access, which provides secure access to external applications, and Zscaler Private Access, which provides secure access to internal applications. The firm is headquartered in San Jose, California, and went public in 2018.","We view Zscalers financial position as healthy. The firm ended fiscal 2023 with around $1.3 billion in cash and liquid investments. While Zscaler does carry debt of around $1.1 billion on its balance sheet, we believe that the firms cash reserves coupled with its ability to generate healthy cash flow from its business will be sufficient to cover its commitments over our explicit forecast.While the firm has not posted GAAP profitability, Zscalers FCFE (free cash flow to equity) margins have been in the black since 2018 and reached 23% in 2023. We expect Zscalers cash generation to improve as the firm increases its operating leverage by toning down some of its research and sales expenditures.Going forward, we do not expect to see a material change in Zscalers capital structure. In a tight macro environment, if the need arises, we expect the firm to raise capital by issuing more equity."
9,22/02/2024,Chorus' Dividend Growth Outlook Is Positive,Chorus Ltd,CNU,3,28/11/2023,Brian Han,8.08,NZD,22/02/2024,7.8,Medium,None,Standard,,28/11/2023,"Shares in Chorus are trading just below our unchanged NZD 7.80 fair value estimate, or AUD 7.20 at current exchange rates. They are also on a yield of 6.3% on our fiscal 2024 DPS forecast of NZD 47.5 cents, albeit not imputed. This is notably higher than the 4% average that ASX and NZX stocks are currently yielding. We are cognizant of the declining yield appeal amid rising interest rates. However, Chorus' yield is secure, with our fiscal 2024 forecast reflective of management's guidance, while the medium-term growth prospects beyond are bright. We forecast the no-moat group's three-year DPS CAGR from fiscal 2024 to be 5%, rising from NZD 47.5 cents to NZD 55.0 cents by fiscal 2027. The growth assumption is in no way heroic, as we project Chorus' free cash flow after sustaining capital expenditure to escalate from an estimated NZD 258 million in fiscal 2024 (NZD 59.3 cents per share) to NZD 335 million in fiscal 2027 (NZD 77.1 cents per share). The arduous build-out of a fiber network to cover 87% of New Zealand's population is on the verge of prodigious monetization. The engine of that monetization is as resilient as any utility service, being fixed-line fiber broadband (currently 83% of Chorus' total connections) to meet the insatiable demand for digital connection and data consumption (585 gigabytes per month on fiber, 273 on copper). Most may go as far as to say broadband access is as nondiscretionary as food and sleep. As such, we see little risk to Chorus distributing around 75% of the expected free cash flows, underpinning our medium-term DPS forecasts. The balance sheet is unlikely to be compromised, with our 4.1 net debt/EBITDA forecast by fiscal 2027 lower than the current 4.4, and comfortably below management's comfort limit of 4.75. Chorus' privileged position and its future cash-generating potential are partly why the group and the Kiwi telecom watchdog have begun the next round of ""regulatory dance""an event some investors may still view as a risk.","Rising demand for data will underpin take-up of fibre-based broadband services. Regulatory certainty has been achieved on copper pricing, and the new fibre regulatory regime is set until 2024.","Chorus lacks pricing power, as the price it can charge access seekers for its network and infrastructure is determined by the set regulatory framework. Unfavorable outcome from any regulatory decisions on access pricing could trigger a decrease in our long-term earnings estimates.",28/11/2023,"Chorus was demerged from Telecom New Zealand in 2011 and is the largest fixed-line access telecommunications infrastructure (copper and fibre) entity in New Zealand. It owns and operates a national fixed-line network that includes local phone exchanges and copper and fibre cables. Chorus partnered with the government in rolling out fibre to the premises though the ultra-fast broadband, or UFB, initiative. As a near-monopoly operator, Chorus' wholesale prices are regulated by the Commerce Commission, or ComCom.  The regulatory framework to govern the group's allowable returns on its fibre infrastructure has been set with no major surprises. Chorus has a solid record of delivering large network rollouts, lowering execution risk. Long-term returns and the value of Chorus will be determined by moderating copper fixed-line connection losses in the near term and demand for fibre services. There is a clear trend of growing data usage as consumers flock to streaming services. We expect data usage to strengthen as richer multimedia and high-quality content uses more bandwidth. One risk is the substitution of wireless broadband to fixed fibre with the advance of wireless technology providing greater speed and bandwidth. At this stage, we do not see wireless broadband as a direct substitute to fixed broadband. Wireless is a shared technology and bandwidth is less consistent compared with fixed fibre. Wireless bandwidth is dependent on the number of users and distance from the tower. We see both technologies complementing each other: users can maximize advantage in portability for wireless devices and larger bandwidth achieved through a fixed-fibre connection. ","We have assigned a no-moat rating to Chorus. The company boasts hard-to-replicate communications infrastructure assets. It owns and operates New Zealand's fixed-line copper network (after its split from Telecom Corporation of New Zealand in 2011). It is also one of only four entities (the others are Northpower, Ultrafast Fibre, Enable) involved in the current ultra-fast broadband rollout around the country. However, Chorus' UFB fibre footprint will be by far the largest, covering 87% of New Zealand population.This privileged status as effectively the fixed-line communications infrastructure backbone in New Zealand (legacy copper and new fibre) attracts material regulatory scrutiny. This is because almost all retail service providers, or RSPs, depend on accessing Chorus' network in order to resell communications services to end users in the country. Consequently, almost 90% of Chorus' revenue is subject to regulated or contracted pricing. The price Chorus currently charges on the newly rolled out fibre network is contractually set by commercial negotiation between the government, Chorus and the industry players. However, this fibre pricing is now subject to a new regulatory framework from 2022. This new regulatory framework to govern the group's allowable returns on its fibre infrastructure currently being rolled out has been set with no major surprises.All this has manifested in our estimated returns on invested capital trailing Chorus' weighted average cost of capital for the next five years and beyond. ","We assign a Morningstar Uncertainty Rating of Medium to Chorus.The main risks facing Chorus are regulatory-related, including: the pricing/quality parameters for the regulatory framework governing its fibre services, higher-than-estimated construction costs of the fibre network, delays in the network rollout, and a low fibre take-up rate.In terms of environmental, social, and governance, or ESG, risks, as the near-monopoly provider of New Zealand's fixed-line broadband infrastructure, subpar quality networks could lead to interruptions and associated expenses, as well as attract regulatory scrutiny. Failure to retain its personnel or continue to attract highly skilled employees, especially engineers and technicians involved in setting up and maintaining the company's network, could result in operational disruptions and financial losses. We view the probability of breaches in these areas as less than 25%, given the solid track record of Chorus since its split from New Zealand Telecom in 2011.","Our Capital Allocation Rating for Chorus is Standard.The balance sheet is sound. Chorus' financial position is improving post a favorable regulatory pricing decision and the new fibre regulatory framework. It ended June 2023 with net debt/EBITDA of 4.4 times, below the covenant limit and management's comfort limit of 4.75.On the investment side, we rate Chorus as fair. Management successfully negotiated with the New Zealand government on the ultrafast broadband initiative and guided Chorus through a tumultuous period of deregulation. The successful completion of the UFB rollout also demonstrates management's infrastructure project execution capability.On shareholder distributions, we rate Chorus as appropriate. As a near-monopoly provider of essential broadband infrastructure in New Zealand and governed by a transparent regulatory regime, Chorus boasts a highly visible and durable earnings base, which can support a relatively high leverage ratio and free cash flow-backed high dividends.","Chorus is New Zealands largest fixed-line communications infrastructure entity, and was demerged in 2011 from Telecom New Zealand. Chorus offers wholesale access to its nationwide copper and fibre network to retail service providers. It also provides backhaul services to retail service providers and connects mobile phone towers. At the end of 2022, Chorus completed the government's rollout of ultra-fast broadband, or UFB, a fibre-to-the-premises network to cover 87% of the population in New Zealand. ","Chorus' financial position is improving. It ended June 2023 with net debt/EBITDA of 4.4 times, below the 5.5 times covenant limit and management's comfort limit of 4.75."

We are reaffirming our no-moat and High Uncertainty ratings. The cold weather nationwide should lead to higher sales volumes and margins at Vistra's generation and retail businesses. Although we expect a positive impact, we aren't making any immediate adjustments to our full-year financial forecasts only three weeks into the year and with the critical summer months ahead. Vistra should benefit the most in Texas, where it has the most customers and 18 gigawatts of generation. Vistra should also benefit from unusually cold weather in the Midwest and Northeast with its $5.7 billion Energy Harbor acquisition. This week demonstrated two key themes in the Texas power markets that will continue to impact revenue and margins for Vistra. Population and business growth is leading to record-breaking electricity demand, a positive for Vistra. The Texas grid operator, Ercot, reported record-setting peak winter demand on Jan. 15-16 even with higher-than-expected energy conservation savings. However, the surge in new solar and battery storage development during the last year limited the grid constraints and peak market prices that Texas experienced during Winter Storm Uri in 2021 and Elliott in 2022. New battery storage projects added 1,200 MW of peak supply, the equivalent of a large nuclear plant, according to Ercot. This new development will continue to limit margin upside for Vistra's legacy generation fleet. Our 2024 EBITDA estimate remains within management's $3.7 billion-$4.1 billion EBITDA guidance range, excluding Energy Harbor. We expect management to continue repurchasing about $1 billion of stock annually. However, the buybacks are unlikely to create incremental value with the stock trading at a large premium to our fair value estimate.","Vistras debt reduction in 2019-20 gives it financial flexibility to repurchase stock, raise the dividend, and finance the Energy Harbor acquisition. Despite recent gas price volatility, Vistras relatively new, efficient gas fleet allows it to earn higher margins than its peers with older, less-efficient power plants. The retail-wholesale integrated business model reduces risk and market transaction costs, allowing Vistra to be a low-cost provider, especially in its primary Texas market.","Low gas and electricity prices hurt the profitability of Vistras coal and nuclear fleet. The retail market is highly competitive with tight margins. A small operational miscue can cripple the business, as weve seen with other retail suppliers. Environmental regulations could lead Vistra to shrink its remaining fossil fuel fleet.",13/09/2023,"Vistra Energy is entering its second phase of life since exiting the Energy Future Holdings bankruptcy in 2016. The $5.7 billion acquisition of Energy Harbor and the restructuring announced in March 2023 pave a strategic path to becoming a leading energy player in markets outside of Texas and boosts Vistra's clean energy credentials. Energy Harbor's four nuclear plants will make Vistra the second-largest U.S. nuclear owner. Vistra is also investing heavily in solar and battery storage. This is a strategic flip since its $2.27 billion acquisition of Dynegy in 2018, which tripled the size of its fossil-fuel generation fleet. The rock-bottom price and cost synergies made the deal highly value-accretive. Vistra's only significant stumble since the EFH bankruptcy exit was the February 2021 winter storm Uri in Texas, which caused more than $2 billion of gross losses. Almost half of Vistra's consolidated earnings continue to come from its fossil-fuel generation fleet, mostly in Texas. Investors remain highly exposed to volatile electricity and natural gas markets, creating more risk than most utilities. Vistra's contracted clean energy business offsets some of this market risk. We think the Energy Harbor acquisition and a corporate structure that can attract direct investment in the clean energy business will result in more stable cash flows, a durable dividend, and regular share buybacks. We expect Vistra to continue closing coal plants until its generation fleet is mostly highly efficient natural gas plants. Vistra's new corporate structure also sets up a possible sale of its fossil fleet. Vistra's clean postbankruptcy balance sheet and high cash flow make it unlikely it would experience a repeat of the EFH bankruptcy, which came just seven years after several high-profile investors closed a $45 billion leveraged buyout, the largest ever at the time. Vistra's largest postbankruptcy shareholders, notably Brookfield and Apollo, were former EFH creditors. Both started exiting their positions in 2018 and 2019, and we expect that selling to continue.","We do not think Vistra has an economic moat, given its exposure to wholesale and retail energy markets.Returns on capital at Vistras wholesale generation and retail energy supply businesses remain subject to volatile power and other commodity prices as well as electricity demand trends. At times during the commodity market cycle, Vistra might create exceptional value for shareholders, but this could be fleeting if commodity markets turn. The 2021 winter storm in Texas proved Vistra's returns on capital remain highly sensitive to energy market conditions.Vistra has high exposure to natural gas markets, especially in the Eastern United States and Texas. Gas prices affect fuel costs for most of Vistras generation fleet and typically drive wholesale electricity prices. Relatively new and efficient gas power plants should give Vistra an advantage over older, less-efficient generators when gas prices climb. The company would also benefit from higher margins at its nuclear and coal plants if gas and power prices remain high.Few of Vistras power plants maintain a low-cost advantage that would be the foundation for establishing an economic moat in the commodity-sensitive merchant power industry. Many of Vistras plants are subject to intense local competition that can quickly erode any excess shareholder returns.Vistras retail businesses also have no economic moat. Energy retailers sell commodity products such as electricity and natural gas. Customers enjoy virtually no switching costs, which makes for intensely competitive markets with tight and volatile margins. This shows in Vistras much lower operating margins at its retail segment.However, Vistra has proved that there are some benefits from pairing its retail supply and clean energy businesses with its wholesale fossil-fuel generation in a given region. This combination has helped reduce earnings volatility and improve returns on capital across the business. Vistra might be able to establish a low-cost advantage in the retail markets where it has substantial wholesale generation presence.","We assign Vistra a High Uncertainty Rating primarily due to its exposure to wholesale and retail energy prices.Vistra also has operating risks. The company must keep its plants operating at high availability levels to take advantage of the times when there are high margins in the wholesale power markets. Vistra also must manage its retail supply risk to protect against unexpected spikes in customer demand and market prices.The winter storm that hit Texas in February 2021 demonstrates the operational and financial risk that Vistra faces. The company reported a $2.9 billion pretax loss related to the storm due to disruptions in the natural gas market during peak energy demand periods. A lack of gas supply forced Vistra's plants to shutdown and required the company to buy power and gas at exceptionally high prices to satisfy its customer commitments.Vistra maintains sufficient cash and liquidity. Before the 2021 Texas storm losses, Vistra had been working toward achieving investment-grade credit ratings by reducing the leverage it added with the Dynegy acquisition. Vistra abrubtly halted that effort and has been distributing more than $1 billion of cash each year to investors through dividends and share buybacks.Vistra will add $3.4 billion of debt as part of the Energy Harbor acquisition. However, Vistra's business creates so much cash on a normalized basis that we think it can handle this leverage even in volatile energy markets, as it showed during winter storm Uri.Vistra also faces environmental, social, and governance risk, given its fossil fuel and nuclear power generation fleet. Across its service territories, regulators and politicians are embracing tighter carbon emissions policies. Vistra is addressing this risk by retiring its coal plants and investing in clean energy such as utility-scale batteries and solar. We consider the impact from ESG factors in our negative moat trend rating and cash flow forecasts.","We give Vistra a Standard capital allocation rating. Management's biggest task during the next few years is achieving the synergies promised as part of the Energy Harbor acquisition and corporate restructuring announced in March 2023.Management has struck a fine balance between returning cash to shareholders, strengthening its balance sheet, making acquisitions, and investing in clean energy projects. Management's prudent capital allocation put it in a strong position to weather one-time setbacks like the February 2021 winter storm in Texas.Managements decisions in 2018-19 to acquire Dynegy and two smaller retail energy companies, repurchase $1.4 billion of stock, and initiate a dividend were aggressive but largely successful.Vistra's minimal core capital spending needs allow it to return substantial amounts of cash to shareholders and fund the Energy Harbor acquisition with $3.4 billion of new debt. After recovering from the 2021 storm losses, management outlined an ambitious five-year, $6 billion stock-repurchase plan, equivalent to 60% of the company's market value at the time. It is on track to complete half of that by the end of 2023 and has board authorization for another $1 billion or repurchases in 2024.We think management's retail-wholesale integration strategy is a good move for shareholders. This strategy has reduced some of the earnings volatility that was associated with the stand-alone wholesale generation business. Management's clean energy investments also will reduce earnings sensitivity to energy markets.CEO Jim Burke succeeded Curt Morgan in August 2022 after Morgan retired. Burke was Vistra's COO for several years and was CEO of Vistra's retail business, TXU Energy, for 11 years. His operational background contrasts with Morgan's private equity background. Burke didn't take long to make his first big financial and strategic move with the Energy Harbor acquisition and restructuring in March 2023.Nuveen and Avenue Capital are set to enter as large shareholders when the Energy Harbor transaction closes. We estimate their combined 15% equity stake in subsidiary Vistra Vision is equivalent to about a 7% stake in Vistra's combined post-deal equity.Three firms that were creditors in the EFH bankruptcyBrookfield, Oaktree, and Apolloheld 26% of Vistra's shares as of early 2019 but have been exiting their positions. Oaktree held 30 million shares, or 6%, as of the most recent filings. Brookfield, which acquired Oaktree in 2019, made its first big sale in December 2019, offloading 30% of its stake, or 20.8 million shares. Apollo has reduced its stake to less than 2%. ","Vistra Energy is one of the largest power producers and retail energy providers in the U.S. Excluding the Energy Harbor acquisition, Vistra owns and operates 38 gigawatts of nuclear, coal, natural gas, and solar power generation. Its retail electricity segment serves 4.3 million customers in 20 states. Vistra's retail business serves almost one third of all Texas electricity consumers. Vistra emerged from the Energy Future Holdings bankruptcy as a stand-alone entity in 2016. It acquired Dynegy in 2018 and plans to close the Energy Harbor acquisition in 2023.","Vistra's quest to earn investment-grade credit ratings and reach 2.5 net debt/EBITDA stalled following the Texas winter storm losses in February 2021. Adding $3.4 billion of debt to buy Energy Harbor will make that goal even more difficult.However, Vistra's assets produce strong cash flows that keep it in what we consider a solid financial position with plenty of liquidity. Vistra's long-term hedges should protect earnings during the next two years, but it could require more cash to cover collateral needs if markets become volatile.Management has shifted its focus toward returning capital to shareholders through stock buybacks and dividends rather than achieving investment-grade credit ratings. Vistra's $2 billion preferred issuance in 2021 with an 8% dividend floor all but ensures it will take several more years to earn investment-grade ratings.Vistra should be able to generate enough cash flow to finish management's five-year, $6 billion stock-repurchase plan started in 2021 even with the Energy Harbor acquisition. We expect the company to continue allocating nearly $1 billion to stock buybacks and $300 million to dividends annually. This combination means the dividend should continue growing at management's target 6%-8% annual rate and top $1.00 per share by 2025, up from $0.50 when the board initiated the dividend in 2019.We also expect Vistra to invest $2 billion in clean energy projects during the next few years. That could grow if Vistra attracts new equity investors to the clean energy business following the Energy Harbor acquisition and restructuring.Vistra exited bankruptcy in 2016 with just $4.5 billion of medium-term debt. Consolidated debt grew to $11 billion after the 2018 Dynegy acquisition before Vistra began reducing its leverage. We expect consolidated debt to approach $16 billion after the Energy Harbor acquisition."
11,22/02/2024,M&T Sees Choppy Deposit Trends but Shares Undervalued,M&T Bank Corp,MTB,4,07/02/2024,Rajiv Bhatia,137.12,USD,21/02/2024,168.0,High,Narrow,Exemplary,C,07/02/2024,"Our thesis on the U.S. banks following the Silicon Bank fallout was that all of the banks we covered, except for First Republic (which we downgraded to a $3 fair value estimate on March 20, 2023, and a $0 fair value on April 27, 2023), would be able to weather the storm. We believed that banks in trouble were in uniquely risky positions. We believe this thesis has largely held up, and sorting through banks based on their unique risk profiles remains necessary and valuable. To the extent that the market is selling off all banks because of what has happened to NYCB, we think there could be opportunities once again while acknowledging the significant time horizon risk (how long does it take for the banks to prove to the market they are fine) and the choppy waters that could occur in the meantime (we expect more commercial real estate related loan losses in the future). We have highlighted that commercial real estate, or CRE, related risks have been lurking behind the scenes for some time. Our CRE thesis has been that there will be losses, it will take years to sort through, and there will likely be some bank failures. However, we again predict our coverage would be able to weather the storm. The latest developments with NYCB have not caused us to change that thesis. While we do not cover NYCB, we have been following the situation. NYCB was in a uniquely risky position. NYCB had materially higher CRE exposure than any bank under our coverage, roughly double or more the amount of CRE exposure relative to capital. NYCB was also subject to increasing regulatory scrutiny because it had recently surpassed $100 billion in assets following its acquisition of Signature Bank. No bank under our coverage is set to see its regulatory requirements change in a similar way. NYCB has also had a more severe deterioration in core profitability. While many banks under our coverage have also seen pressure on profits, NYCB is coming under more pressure than most banks we cover.","The acquisition of People's United was done at a good price and should drive additional future growth, providing the bank a unique growth driver that many peers will not have. Current valuations are less demanding for the banking sector, including M&T. There is potential future upside for the banks that can successfully navigate the current turmoil. MTB has loyal customers and good management; investors shouldn't have to worry much about being burned by bad underwriting.","Banks are tied to the economy and the interest-rate environment. If the economy falters and/or the rate environment is negative, bank earnings and shares will suffer. There are few positive catalysts left for the banks. Funding costs are running higher, net interest income has likely peaked, higher regulatory scrutiny is likely, and a potential recession may be around the corner. MTB's loan book is heavily concentrated in commercial real estate, and business prospects in certain CRE sectors may be permanently altered after the pandemic.",30/11/2023,"M&T Bank is a midsize regional bank with operations throughout the Northeastern United States. The bank has a valuable commercial real estate franchise, with much of the rest of its business comprising other commercial-focused (as opposed to retail-focused) operations, although the bank does have retail operations. M&T has a history of good management, good underwriting, and deep on-the-ground relationships. The bank is a solid regional operator. MTB acquired People's United Bank in April 2022. This move has further expanded M&T's geographical reach in the Northeast, primarily into Connecticut along with Massachusetts and the New York City area. The acquisition expanded the bank's equipment financing-related product offerings. We liked the pricing of the deal and expect that cost savings alone will justify the acquisition. With merger related expenses set to drop to essentially zero in 2023, we're getting a better look at the true expense run rate for the combined entity. After 2023, it will be up to the bank to drive additional revenue growth as new commercial products are cross-sold into newer geographies and as M&T also potentially picks up some new retail customers along the way. The bank has also recently sold off its insurance brokerage unit and a portion of its fund administration business, moves that we think make sense in what are consolidating industries. MTB, like many regional banks, derives a majority (roughly two thirds) of its income from net interest income. As such, the bank's earnings are sensitive to movements in interest rates. The remaining one third of revenue comes from different fee sources, including wealth management, deposit service fees, and mortgage fees. MTB has one of the largest CRE exposures under our coverage; this is once again coming under increased scrutiny. While certain CRE assets (now office properties) have come under unique pressure, M&T's underwriting remains solid, and while losses have occurred, they have been very manageable. Going forward, M&T's ability to deal with a slowing NYC CRE market and grow out additional revenue from its recent acquisition will be important.","We believe M&T Bank has earned a narrow moat because it possesses durable cost advantages and switching costs that are consistent with our bank moat framework. Spread-earning banks generally earn moats by paying less interest on deposits, controlling noninterest expenses, and/or managing credit costs better than their peers. These factors lead banks with moats to have durably higher returns on equity than their cost of capital. We also consider the strength of fee-based income streams and overall scale and product scope when we think about competitive positioning for our banking coverage. We assign a 9% cost of equity for all U.S. regional banks and project M&T Bank to easily exceed this hurdle with returns on tangible common equity averaging 14% over our forecast period. Our analysis shows that M&T Bank has built a narrow moat through durable controls in its deposit costs, operating expenditures, and credit costs.M&T Banks low-cost deposit base gives the company a deposit cost advantage, and the bank's strong relationships with customers result in switching costs. Evidence shows MTB retains higher proportions of non-interest-bearing deposits in a variety of interest-rate environments. Further, the bank has a number of strong commercial relationships where deposit pricing can be made in the context of the total relationship. Both of these factors lead us to expect MTB will maintain its durably lower interest costs relative to total deposits.M&T Bank has historically had strong operating efficiency, which bolsters its narrow moat. M&Ts efficiency is demonstrated through the efficiency ratio, which has consistently been below 60% in most environments. While its costs have risen faster than peers' in the recent past, we believe M&T will continue managing noninterest costs effectively enough and expect that its efficiency will remain within the same range as narrow-moat peers'. We think that the relatively low noninterest expense is a function of the companys scale and concentration of deposits (nearly 90% of deposits are in MTBs top 10 metropolitan statistical areas) since noninterest expenses do not scale with deposits. Given its regional focus, we do not expect MTB to seek deposit growth in unproductive areas outside its region.M&T Bank adds to its moat by underwriting quality loans, thereby controlling credit costs. MTB has one of the best underwriting histories under our coverage and has consistently outperformed peers through multiple downturns. MTB controlled its charge-offs relative to average loans quite well during the financial crisis, even though about half of its loans were exposed to real estate in 2008. MTBs credit cost advantage is based on the companys well-established focus on risk-adjusted yield, which was set in place by the late longtime CEO Robert Wilmers. We do not expect this credit culture to change. We will admit that many of M&T's peers have improved in underwriting quality since 2008, and these costs do not tend to be true differentiators except in a serious downturn, so this advantage may be smaller going forward.From a systemic standpoint, we believe the U.S. banking system has improved over the last decade, as capital levels supporting the banking system are at all-time highs. Further, regulation has become considerably stronger in the past several years. The U.S. banking market is quite fragmented, and MTB must compete with a variety of regional and community banks as well as large money center institutions, although this fragmentation has gradually decreased since the 1990s. While we do view the banking sector as intensely competitive, the largest banks by asset size have generally been able to earn higher returns on equity for the last several decades and still do so today. Our outlook is generally positive from a macroeconomic and political standpoint for the U.S. banking system, as the U.S. is still the world's leading democracy, has increased GDP at a steady pace for years, and maintains the world's reserve currency, all of which contribute to banking stability.MTB is considered a Category IV bank, and is only subject to biennial stress tests by the U.S. Federal Reserve, is not subject to any leverage ratio requirements, and is also free from more stringent liquidity requirements. The bank must pass $250 billion in assets before triggering additional regulatory requirements.","We view the macroeconomic backdrop as the primary risk to the bank. M&T's profitability is largely determined by the interest-rate cycle and the effects of credit and debt cycles, all of which are not under management's control.Over the long term, credit quality has been good. However, M&T is not immune to the overall credit environment. Its exposure to the commercial real estate market is relatively high, and M&T has a presence in expensive markets, like New York and Washington, D.C. If these areas were to experience greater economic troubles, M&T's earnings could suffer. Like most of its peers, M&T is also subject to the vagaries of interest-rate movements, and rate cuts present a challenge for M&T.From an environmental, social, and governance perspective, commercial banks are expected to have strong product governance. Predatory or discriminatory lending practices are examples of poor product governance, and this can affect certain banks at times. We view most product governance and social risks as manageable and incorporate a steady level of operational expenses related to compliance and litigation in our models. Outside of the rare, headline-grabbing scandals, we dont see social risks as having a material effect on our valuation. Banks also lend to certain sectors that can come under more scrutiny at times, like gun manufacturers or energy, for example. Commercials banks dont directly have a large environmental footprint, and governance practices are in line with most companies.We typically assign our U.S. regional banks a Medium Uncertainty Rating, however due to heightened deposit base, funding cost, and regulatory uncertainty, we have raised the Uncertainty Rating for M&T Bank to High.","We give MTB an Exemplary capital allocation rating. In our opinion, the companys balance sheet is sound, its capital investment decisions are exemplary, and its capital return strategy is appropriate. With solid underwriting and a consistent common equity Tier 1 ratio around or above 10% over time, the balance sheet is sound, in our view. The bank was also one of the more conservative banks under our coverage when it came to taking duration risk, further strengthening the bank's positioning in the current environment.We view the company's capital investments as exemplary, as M&T has avoided investing capital in value-destroying products, such as mortgage-backed securities during the great financial crisis, while prudently underwriting loans through multiple cycles. The bank is concentrated in CRE lending, which can be difficult to get right, and M&T has shown an ability to allocate capital appropriately here. This is evidenced by the bank's low charge-offs through multiple cycles, including during the 2008-09 global financial crisis, which has allowed MTB to maintain cash payouts to shareholders during some of the toughest downturns. It should not come as a surprise to longtime observers that M&T is also successfully navigating the current rise in duration risk. MTB has pursued value-adding acquisitions and organic growth. M&T purchased distressed banks such as Wilmington Trust and Hudson City and used their substantial local market shares to gain access to wealthy customers. The distressed banks were purchased at reasonable prices, and M&T was largely successful at integrating their operations. We think the recent acquisition of People's United should follow a similar pattern and add some value for shareholders as we see cost savings playing out as expected, with any additional revenue being an extra bonus (keeping in mind how hard these revenue synergies can be to actually bring to fruition). MTB has proved to be a durable, high-return franchise for decades.We assess the companys capital return strategy as appropriate. M&T, generally pays out roughly 30% of earnings as dividends and uses excess capital to support growth and make share repurchases. M&T prefers to use excess capital for internal investments or acquisitions when available. Given the current setup, we see the bank as well positioned among our coverage compared with peers to pursue more aggressive share repurchases while shares are trading at more attractive valuations. We would not be surprised to see additional repurchases in the quarters to come.Rene Jones was named chair and CEO in 2017 after the sudden death of Robert Wilmers, who captained the bank for more than 30 years. Jones served as CFO for more than a decade, and we think M&T remains in capable hands. Jones has a sizable equity stake in the company, which we think aligns managements incentives with shareholder incentives.","M&T Bank is one of the largest regional banks in the United States, with branches in New York, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Virginia, Maryland, Delaware, and New Jersey. The bank was founded to serve manufacturing and trading businesses around the Erie Canal and is primarily focused on commercial real estate and commercial-related lending, with some retail operations also present.","We think MTB is in good financial health. The bank withstood the crisis better than peers and has maintained a credit cost advantage over subsequent economic cycles. Deposits fund roughly three fourths of total assets and we view the bank's deposit base as stable enough to navigate the current banking industry turmoil. While capital adequacy has been an area of increased debate recently within the banking industry in general, we do not have concerns about capital for M&T Bank. The bank's common equity Tier 1 ratio was 10.9% as of third quarter 2023, above management's target, and the bank was one of the most conservative among our coverage when it came to taking duration risk. While there is some uncertainty around future regulatory changes, the bank already has a CET1 ratio, even including AOCI, that exceeds its 8.5% minimum. In fact, we think M&T is in a unique position compared with peers to be fairly aggressive on share repurchases while its shares are trading at a more attractive valuation."
12,22/02/2024,Our Long-Term LKQ Thesis Remains Intact Following CEO Retirement Announcement,LKQ Corp,LKQ,3,,Dawit Woldemariam,50.32,USD,21/02/2024,49.0,Medium,Narrow,Standard,B,,,"Growth in miles driven increases the wear and tear on vehicles, requiring more maintenance and repair work to keep them on the road, benefiting LKQ. LKQs collision business could see rising demand from increasing auto claims as more drivers return to the road following the COVID-19 pandemic. Increasing adoption of hybrid vehicles presents new revenue opportunities for LKQ, such as new battery-related parts, in addition to its ICE-related parts.","Increasing adoption of ADAS technology could lead to a reduction in the number of auto accidents, pressuring LKQs collision business. The companys 1 LKQ Europe initiative could face challenges in rationalizing its product portfolio and improving its procurement systems. Bottlenecks in the ocean freight industry could extend the average time it takes for LKQs imported aftermarket parts to reach its operating regions, making it difficult for the firm to maintain its high order fulfillment rates.",27/11/2023,"LKQ is the top alternative vehicle-parts provider to repair shops in North America and Europe. We believe the company benefits from scale-driven cost advantages in its business. Customers value LKQs consistent parts availability across a wide range of products and quick delivery. LKQ helps customers complete repairs faster, improving productivity. We think the companys strong distribution network will support its ability to keep order fulfillment rates high in both aftermarket and salvage products.  The companys strategy focuses on being a one-stop shop for repair professionals, ranging from salvage products to aftermarket and remanufactured parts. LKQs parts are a strong alternative to original equipment manufacturers parts, exhibiting high quality in comparison. While insurance companies arent usually direct customers, they do have sway over which parts are used in vehicle repairs. LKQs alternative parts allows insurance companies to reduce their cost base while also reducing the cycle time for repairs. Historically, the company has used acquisitions to build up its capabilities and footprint, but that has changed over the past few years. LKQ has shifted its focus to integrating its businesses and improving its cost structure, and we believe it will aim to make smaller tuck-in acquisitions as opposed to larger deals.  We think LKQ is well positioned to compete as electric vehicle adoption increases. The shift to EVs will present new revenue opportunities for the company, in our view. In both hybrid and full-electric vehicles, new parts will be needed to keep vehicles on the road. For example, we expect to see increased demand for battery-related parts and a need for remanufactured or refurbished batteries.  LKQ has exposure to end markets with attractive tailwinds. We think demand for vehicle repair work will be strong in the near term, largely due to the high average age of vehicles.","Over the past two decades, LKQ has evolved from an auto salvage business to a comprehensive alternative parts provider, which extends to aftermarket, remanufactured, and refurbished auto parts. As the largest player in the highly fragmented auto-parts industry, LKQ benefits primarily from scale-driven cost advantages over smaller competitors, in our view. LKQ is the largest auto-parts distributor in North America and Europe. We believe smaller local and regional competitors will struggle to win market share in both regions, given LKQs strong distribution network, efficient inventory management, and extensive customer service capabilities. We award LKQ a narrow economic moat rating because we expect its competitive positioning will allow it to generate excess returns over the next decade. We think LKQs high fulfillment rates are driven by its product breadth and consistent product availability. LKQs primary customers are collision and mechanical vehicle repair shops, which need auto parts on demand. These customers value LKQs ability to maintain optimal inventory levels for a wide range of products. Repair shops usually work under tight time constraints, so finding the desired part when they need it is important to them. We estimate LKQs order fulfillment rates for aftermarket products are approximately 95% compared with about 65% for its competitors. In addition, we estimate fulfillment rates for salvage parts are about 75% for LKQ versus roughly 25% for competitors. In our view, this shows that LKQs product breadth and extensive customer service capabilities are unmatched by peers. We also believe LKQ benefits from cost advantages stemming from global product sourcing and scalable distribution networks. In the aftermarket vertical, LKQ globally sources aftermarket parts from independent manufacturers in Taiwan in addition to the United States. This dynamic helps the company earn higher gross profit margins in comparison with smaller peers. Additionally, we think LKQs distribution network is a differentiator. The company operates national distribution centers that help stock branches with popular parts. The distribution network is also flexible enough to shift inventory between LKQs facilities to meet demand, utilizing the companys own fleet of trucks. We believe this allows LKQ to cost-effectively serve its customer base, which requires high product availability. We think LKQs well-developed salvage procurement system drives its ability to keep costs low. The company sources its recycled vehicles from car auctions. LKQs bidders utilize internally developed software to cross-check current inventory levels and average selling prices to determine an optimal bid for vehicles. This prevents the company from overspending on vehicles, driving higher profitability compared with smaller peers. After recycled vehicles are bought at auction, LKQ breaks them down into individual parts, which are then sold to vehicle repair shops. Each year, we estimate LKQ acquires over 300,000 vehicles for its salvage business. We believe LKQs procurement process is the best in the industry. The company efficiently catalogs parts and utilizes artificial intelligence to improve its vehicle assessment capabilities. AI technology allows LKQ to catch damage to vehicles that its bidding specialists fail to see.LKQ has historically been very acquisitive, but that changed in 2019. The management teams roll-up strategy helped LKQ venture into new product verticals and expand its geographical footprint. LKQ moved into selling customers aftermarket, remanufactured, and refurbished auto parts in addition to its salvage products. By expanding its product offering, LKQ has become a one-stop shop for customers. The company has also increased its footprint globally. During its early days, LKQ was solely a North American business, but today it also operates in Europe. The companys European operations commenced in 2011 and have grown significantly since. Currently, the region generates nearly $6 billion in annual sales compared with less than $1 billion in 2012.Acquisitions have been a key reason LKQ has built scale-driven cost advantages in its business. That said, the companys invested capital base has increased along with the growth in acquisitions over the past decade. Earnings before interest has also grown over the same period, but not at the same pace as invested capital. Adjusted returns on invested capital decreased from approximately 17% in 2015 to about 10% in 2019. During this period, LKQ increased its acquisition activity, which resulted in a larger asset base. Since, the management team has signaled its desire to shift away from its acquisition-heavy strategy, opting to focus more on driving organic growth and cost efficiencies. We believe future acquisitions will more likely be small-tuck-ins as opposed to the large deals of the past. In our view, the pivot in managements acquisition strategy will push adjusted returns on invested capital past 2015 levels, averaging approximately 20% over the next five years. Additionally, we think LKQ is focused on improving its net leverage position (net debt/EBITDA) in the near term. Over the past five years, its net leverage ratio has declined from about 3 times to under 2 times. This resulted in the company reaching investment-grade status. To maintain this level, LKQ will need to focus on improving its cost structure to drive higher EBITDA growth, in our opinion. This will require the company to shift away from making large M&A deals. LKQ did recently acquire Uni-Select, which has pushed its leverage ratio up to 2.4 times. However, we think the company can get its net leverage ratio down under 2 times within 18 months of the deal closing. We also think LKQs competitive position is entrenched enough to fend off competition from smaller players. The companys peers are local and regional players, while LKQ is a national leader. The likelihood of peers winning away market share from LKQ is rather low, in our view. We expect LKQs Europe business to be on better footing in the next couple of years. The companys European operations was built up through multiple acquisitions over the past decade. Today, LKQ is the largest distributor of automotive aftermarket parts in Europe. The management team has shifted its focus away from acquiring more businesses in the region to integrating its operations. We believe LKQ will be successful in its efforts to drive cost efficiencies in Europe through its 1 LKQ Europe initiative. Similar to its efforts in North America over the years, we think LKQ will drive procurement costs down by rationalizing its product portfolio. We also think the company can develop efficient and scalable distribution networks to cost-effectively serve its customer base. We forecast EBITDA margins to grow from 10% currently to nearly 11% by 2024.We do not think LKQs narrow economic moat faces any substantial threats from ESG risks. The company has exposure to emission regulation through its fleet operations. LKQ uses its own trucks to move products between facilities. We think LKQ is investing to position itself to win in a zero-emission world. In the United Kingdom and Ireland, the company has launched a six-month pilot for electric trucks. The management team has also expressed its willingness to test fuel-cell trucks in the future. We expect LKQ to be ready for the eventual shift to alternative-power vehicles. Furthermore, we think new emission regulation will likely be introduced gradually over the next decade. This will give LKQ time to invest in next generation products that will aim to reduce emissions.","We assign LKQ a Medium Morningstar Uncertainty Rating.The automotive industry is highly cyclical, as its strength depends on employment and income levels, in addition to financing availability. However, we believe LKQ is uniquely positioned to benefit during economic downturns. During periods of economic stress, consumers typically pull back on making new vehicle purchases, opting to keep their current vehicles longer. As accidents occur and vehicles break down, owners turn to alternative parts to get their vehicles back on the road. This results in rising demand for alternative parts providers like LKQ.While LKQ is the market leader in the fragmented alternative parts industry, it does face competition from smaller players. That said, competitors maintain lower order fulfillment rates in comparison. LKQs consistent parts availability and fast delivery are the result of a strong distribution network that can move parts between facilities relatively quickly, ultimately getting them into customers hands fast. We estimate LKQs fulfillment rates to be approximately 95% in aftermarket parts and about 75% for salvage parts. Lastly, the shift away from internal combustion engine vehicles may result in lower demand for repairs in the future. This reality could translate into lower sales for LKQ. The companys success will depend on its ability to provide more EV parts. We do not think this is a major risk for LKQ as we believe its parts inventory will be able to quickly adapt if demand for EVs increases. If auto suppliers materially accelerate their production of EV-related parts, LKQ will be able to shift its procurement efforts to acquire more EVs, in addition to working with its manufacturing partners to develop aftermarket parts. These factors lead us to assign a medium uncertainty rating, given LKQs ability to mitigate each of the risks it faces.","We assign LKQ a Standard Morningstar Capital Allocation Rating. The rating reflects our overall assessment that the companys balance sheet is sound and the quality of its investing (reinvestment and acquisitions) is fair and supports its competitive positioning. We think LKQs shareholder distributions are appropriate. We think LKQ has a sound balance sheet. its debt balance has steadily declined over the past few years thanks to the management teams focus on improving its net leverage position to reach investment-grade status. These factors lead us to assign a low balance sheet risk for LKQ. We believe the companys debt is manageable, given our expectation that LKQs cash position will improve over our forecast based on its shift from making large M&A deals to small tuck-ins. LKQs investment strategy is fair, in our view. The company has mostly favored inorganic growth historically, but the management team has signaled a pivot in its strategy. We think LKQ will focus more on improving its cost structure and expanding its business organically. Going forward, we expect LKQ to strategically make acquisitions to enhance its product offering. For example, the company recently made a few acquisitions that expanded its footprint in diagnostics. Increasingly, repair work is relying on diagnostic devices for repair data and vehicle calibration. LKQs efforts to expand into diagnostics presents an attractive opportunity to deepen its relationship customers, ultimately removing the need for repair professionals to send vehicles to dealerships for recalibration after making their fixes.In August 2023, LKQ announced acquired Uni-Select in an all-cash deal for $2.1 billion. The purchase price comes out to CAD 48 per share (approximately $35.29). The company funded the deal through a combination of cash on hand and debt. Management said its leverage ratio would rise to 2.4 times at closing before declining to under 2 times within 18 months of close. Including synergies, the deal represented an acquisition multiple of 9.7 times EV/forward 2023 EBITDA. This roughly matched our 10 times EV/forward EBITDA multiple that we calculated using FactSet consensus following the deal announcement. In terms of cost synergies, LKQ is projecting the deal to bring approximately $55 million in annual run-rate synergies by the third year following the close. Given how similar these two businesses are, we think its reasonable to assume LKQ can achieve its cost synergy target. The three synergy buckets include optimizing the combined footprint, lowering procurement costs, and realizing selling, general, and administrative efficiencies.In our view, LKQs capital allocation strategy will be more balanced in the future. We think one of the companys top priorities will be reinvesting in the business. With respect to its distribution network, we believe LKQ will continue building out its regional networks. The deciding factor for customers is whether a distributor has the part theyre looking for and can they get it in their hands quickly to make their repairs. We think LKQ will continue to improve its delivery processes, making it easier for parts to be shipped between its facilities to meet customer demand. We also believe the management team will be able to quickly shift its business to accommodate any increase in EV parts demand. LKQ has a long record of being able to shift procurement efforts based on demand. We also think LKQ will benefit from new revenue streams as a result of increased EV adoption, for example, increased sales of battery-related parts. LKQ recently announced that President and CEO Dominick Zarcone is retiring effective June 30, 2024. Justin Jude, the current president of LKQs North America wholesale business, will become the new CEO. Notably, Jude has extensive experience at LKQ (spanning nearly 20 years), including roles in the companys sales, supply chain, and information systems departments. We foresee no material changes to the companys capital allocation strategy following the CEO change.We believe shareholder distributions are appropriate. We think management is committed to repurchasing shares, evidenced by the recent announcement to increase its share repurchase program by $1 billion to $3.5 billion. This also marks the companys pivot away from making large acquisitions, freeing up more capital to buy back shares. Additionally, management recently raised the quarterly dividend to $0.30 per share from $0.275 previously. LKQ paid its first-ever quarterly dividend of $0.25 in the fourth quarter of 2021. We also believe the company will return nearly all of its free cash flow to shareholders throughout the economic cycle, while also reinvesting in the business. In a midcycle environment, we expect free cash flow to be over $1 billion.","LKQ is a global distributor of non-OEM automotive parts. Initially formed in 1998 as a consolidator of auto salvage operations in the United States, it has since greatly expanded its scope to include distribution of new mechanical and collision parts, specialty auto equipment, and remanufactured and recycled parts in both Europe and North America. It still maintains its auto salvage business and owns over 70 LKQ pick-your-part junkyards. Separate from the self-service business, LKQ purchases over 300,000 salvage automobiles annually that are used to extract parts for resale. Globally, the company maintains approximately 1,700 facilities.","LKQ maintains a sound balance sheet. Its debt balance was $3.7 billion in the third quarter of 2023. LKQs management team has been focused on strengthening the balance sheet over the past few years. The companys net leverage position (net debt/EBITDA) has steadily improved, declining from nearly 3 times to under 2 times. This resulted in LKQ reaching investment-grade status. Following the Uni-Select deal, LKQ's leverage ratio rose to 2.4 times. We think the company can get its net leverage ratio down under 2 times within 18 months of the deal closing.In terms of liquidity, we believe LKQ will be on solid footing over the long term. Cash stood at $401 million in the third quarter, but we think this will likely increase over our forecast, given the companys shift in its acquisition strategy. In the past, LKQ was more willing to acquire companies to expand its capabilities and footprint. We believe management will now focus on small tuck-ins, freeing up more cash to reinvest in its business, repurchase shares and grow its dividend. We think a stronger cash position will help LKQ quickly react to a changing operating environment as well as meet any near-term debt obligations. In addition, we also find comfort in LKQs ability to access $2.0 billion in credit facilities. LKQs solid balance sheet gives management the financial flexibility to run a balanced capital allocation strategy going forward that mostly favors organic growth and also returns cash to shareholders. We believe LKQ can generate solid free cash flow throughout the economic cycle. We expect the company to generate over $1 billion in free cash flow in our midcycle year, supporting its ability to return free cash flow to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Additionally, we think free cash flow growth over the next decade will be supported by improving EBITDA margins in LKQs Europe business, which we expect to be in the low-double-digit range over the next five years."
13,22/02/2024,"Despite Cyclical Headwinds, We Think Emerson Is Well Positioned to Capture Secular Automation Trends",Emerson Electric Co,EMR,3,07/02/2024,Krzysztof Smalec,104.96,USD,21/02/2024,113.0,Medium,Wide,Standard,A,07/02/2024,"Wide-moat-rated Emerson posted solid fiscal first-quarter results, as its revenue of $4.1 billion and adjusted EPS of $1.22 both easily beat the FactSet consensus estimates of $3.9 billion and $1.04, respectively. Weve raised our fair value estimate to $113 from $109, which reflects our slightly more optimistic near-term revenue growth and incremental margin projections as well as time value of money. Emerson delivered 10% year-over-year underlying sales growth in the fiscal first quarter, fueled by strong demand in the process and hybrid end markets. Volume leverage coupled with a favorable price-cost spread and strong execution resulted in 41% operating leverage, above managements prior mid-30% guidance. The test and measurement business started the year with a strong quarter, and the integration work is moving ahead of pace. Management increased and accelerated its cost synergy targets and now expects $185 million in cost synergies by year 3 (including $80 million in 2024), up from the previous estimate of $165 million by year 5. The planned cost to reach these synergies increased from $155 million to $165 million. Emerson raised its outlook for full-year fiscal 2024 and now anticipates net sales growth of 14.5%-17% (up from 13%-15.5%) and adjusted EPS of $5.30-$5.45 (up from $5.15-$5.35). Discrete automation orders were down, which was consistent with our expectations as its end markets are shorter-cycle and are typically the first to decline in a softening macroeconomic environment. Emersons underlying orders grew 4% in the fiscal first quarter, and the process and hybrid end markets remain robust.",Emerson is the undisputed king of process automation with the industrys largest installed base in the Americas. AspenTech gives Emerson a far firmer footing in the enviable industrial software market and fits in nicely with its automation portfolio and other software assets. Emerson's sale of climate tech to Blackstone should unlock shareholder value.,"Emerson has a spotty history of integrating M&A, which doesn't bode well for the AspenTech acquisition. Emerson overpaid for NI, and the transaction destroys shareholder value. Investors won't give Emerson the benefit of a pure-play premium multiple without selling additional noncore assets.",07/02/2024,"In our view, Emerson Electric is the undisputed powerhouse in process manufacturing on the west side of the Atlantic. Despite near-term headwinds, we believe the firm is poised for several years of positive organic growth. Its total addressable automation market, both served and unserved, totals over $200 billion, of which approximately 59% is in hardware and services, 32% in control product software, and 9% stand-alone software. Even as Emerson holds either first or second share in a variety of product categories, established firms' share remains somewhat fragmented (depending on the category, Emerson holds roughly midteens market share), suggesting a large runway for growth.  We believe automation can add more to manufacturing firms bottom lines than many other investments. Additionally, we think predictive analytics will augment these results, given the mission-critical nature of Emerson's products and services. We believe Emerson will benefit from fewer available experts than can adequately address in-demand automation services; industrywide share of mind as evidenced by a multitude of awards from various trade publications; and most importantly, its large installed base, which allows the company to benefit from decades of higher-margin aftermarket revenue.  Once David Farr relinquished the helm, we expected CEO Lal Karsanbhai and the board would revisit a potential breakup close to Emerson's 2022 investor day. While our thesis was confirmed, it was only partially so: Management sold portions of climate technologies to Blackstone but retained its tools business. We think this somewhat undermined the sale as a catalyst, because we don't believe rolling tools into automation makes much strategic sense. Conversely, we think the purchases of a majority of AspenTech and National Instruments make strategic sense, even though Emerson clearly overpaid for the latter.","We assign Emerson Electric a wide economic moat based primarily on switching costs and secondarily on intangible assets. We view its automation business as a wide-moat business. Our assessment hinges on our degree of confidence in the business competitive position.Emersons automation business is built on the automation industrys largest installed base of $120 billion. Process manufacturing infrastructure (as seen in oil and gas, chemical, and refining facilities)what Emerson is most known forhas a 20- to 50-year life span. Switching costs are strong because most companies cant afford a wholesale replacement of their existing control systems. Switches to lesser-known competitors are uncommon from a risk management standpoint, given the catastrophic cost of failure. Shutting down a continuous process is risky. Many operators and maintenance technicians often get a chance to stop, service, and restart a continuous process only once every seven years. Given this dynamic, Emerson increasingly benefits from fewer available industry experts that can appropriately address service requirements. Moreover, operators lack of practice and familiarity with required procedures often leads to heightened chances of accidents and waste, and a breakdown in a plants existing systems can translate to heavy losses (some estimates peg up to $1 million in losses per plant). While its cheaper in the short term for firms to operate a run-to-failure strategy, over the long run, plant facilities that fail to implement preventative maintenance end up spending more. In addition to the cost of unplanned downtime, a firms failure to maintain its facilities shortens the life span of its capital investment. In the event of a sudden plant shutdown, not only do individual components fail, but so do secondary systems, like shafts or motors.Regulation reinforces these switching costs. The U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration places increasing emphasis on recognized and generally accepted good engineering practices. As such, its no longer acceptable to assign blame for catastrophic incidents on prior plant owners. Equipment and service providers like Emerson can implement systems that lead to meaningful reductions in the number of alarms triggered by machine failures (some figures indicate reductions of up to 70%), allowing operators and technicians to focus on the root causes of machine failure. Moreover, some studies reported in automation trade magazine stress the need for predictive maintenance over preventive approaches. Only 18% of machine failures are caused by age, while the remaining 82% are random events. Aside from reducing the cost of maintenance, predictive maintenance tools translate into increased uptime, increased throughput, improved product quality through optimization, and reduced waste and rework.That said, while manufacturing facilities may have predictive maintenance tools in place, they may not be using them to their full capabilities. In addition to lack of experience from technicians and operators, customers staff do not have the time or resources to sift through an abundance of diagnostic data. As a result, plants depend on experts from established firms like Emerson to mine the data given their comprehensive expertise around control valves, physical metering, and systems health monitoring. For example, many plant engineers are well versed in the theory of vibration monitoring (which can be used to detect loose bearings, for example), but these techniques are not always applied correctly, leading to inconsistent measurements and misleading conclusions drawn from data. These are highly skilled techniques which require experts to consider vibration range and sensitivity, frequency, and temperature.Skilled services like these are generally provided under long-term agreements and have allowed Emerson to move from purely an equipment and traditional service business, to increasingly providing consulting services. We believe this has borne out quantitativelyEmersons public transcripts, from our understanding, reveal that these types of services constitute greater than 25% of segment sales. This type of service revenue is higher margin than Emersons product business, which incidentally provides the firm more ammunition for capital spending, allowing it to extend its already massive installed base. According to multiple experts, customers benefit because automation correctly applied can add more value to the bottom line than any other business investment. Furthermore, Emerson estimates that the total addressable market for automation is $204 billion, suggesting a large runway for growth. Even so, competitors attempting to catch Emerson would struggle replicating the firms installed base. Based on Emersons experience and those of its closest competitors, it would likely take an opposing firm 10-20 years to become a credible player in the automation space. The technology that affords competitors and Emersons components a high degree of measurement accuracy is often only the cost of entry. However, we think what differentiates Emerson is its ability to provide customers a comprehensive solution of both software and component products and services. In part, we think this is helped by Emerson spending over $300 million a year on research and development. On the product side, smart instrumentation like the kind Emerson offers can drive meaningful (up to triple-digit) increases in identifying defects and efficiency of certain energy systems. For example, its Coriolis flowmeters, which measure mass flows of liquids, and are widely used for custody transfer applications of petroleum liquids, can lower customers total cost of ownership in critical applications, despite their higher capital cost. One such use case for flowmeters is titanium dioxide, which is added to fine white paper to help meet requirements for brightness and whiteness. Customers that use too much titanium dioxide incur substantial costs, while those that use too little produce off-spec paper. Magnetic flowmeters cause inaccurate measurement in this use case, which can result in a 15% rejection rate for either insufficient brightness or whiteness. A Coriolis meter interfaced with a control system can save a facility up to $250,000 per year, conservatively computed. Emerson, furthermore, has continued its product innovation by eliminating complex installations with an all-welded spool design that doesnt require an orifice plate. This design supports up to four individual flow transmitters, and further tolerates extreme temperature conditions, whereas previous iterations would have broken down the instrumentation. These types of incremental product innovations allow the firm to extract higher price points from its products.Other product innovations have taken place at the controller level. Traditionally, Emersons offerings are associated with its strength in process manufacturing, such as distributed control systems required for continuous or complex batch processes. A DCS is highly reliable, but historically expensive, large, and complex to implement. This contrasts with Rockwells strength, for example, in programmable logic controllers, which are traditionally associated with discrete manufacturing (for example, as in autos or electronics) and are more flexible. These traditional distinctions have blurred over time. For example, Emerson has developed a controller that allows it to autoconfigure and decouples it from traditional inputs and outputs but acts like a node in its DeltaV network (the firms DCS architecture). In other words, this type of innovation provides customers with the flexibility of a PLC, but with the reliability of a DCS as required in certain hybrid offerings like life sciences. We suspect this could also provide Emerson with positive optionality in the form of additional use cases. Additional product innovations include Emersons Asco Numatics zoned safety valve island, which can be specifically configured to shut down a specific group of valves without requiring an operator shut down an entire machine and incur expensive downtime. These islands further reduce the required number of components, save space, improve design flexibility, from our understanding. Finally, were enthused by digital twin technology, which uses simulation to allow customers to test new plant control designs. In one use case, a large petrochemical company identified efficiency and cost savings on the order of millions of dollars but couldnt shut down the plant to test these ideas. This simulation allowed the firm to test ideas which resulted in an immediate payoff of $500,000 in energy costs saved, as conservatively estimated by the customer.Emerson also benefits from a strong reputation in automation, as well as a high share of mind. Control Global magazine, which solicits nominations from engineer respondents based on fill-in-the blank nominations, rated Emerson number one in both device and plant asset management in 2018. Emersons Plantweb was similarly ranked number one in Control Engineering magazine for software diagnostics. We think these types of recognitions are important. According to Boston Consulting Group, 40% of Internet of Things customers prefer to use traditional and well-established companies for Internet of Things solutions. We estimate returns on invested capital (inclusive of goodwill) for the segment typically and consistently range from 10% to 15%. While the excess returns spread is not large for the segment (given the capital-intense nature of the business), were confident in the firms position in the automation space. Only when oil dropped from $105 in 2014 to $26 in 2016 do we estimate that the segments returns dropped to cost of capital, even as the firms installed base had over 30% exposure to upstream and midstream oil and gas. Given that the segments installed base is making incremental pivots away from oil and gas, coupled with the fact we would not expect a 75% drop in oil prices to become a normal occurrence, we have a high degree of certainty of a normalized excess spread over our calculated cost of capital. Finally, the firms tools business (now housed within safety and productivity) primarily benefits from strong brands, like Ridgid tools. Ridgid is a franchise business with over 95 years in existence and a strong reputation, particularly among plumbers, given the brands strong historical association with the pipe wrench. The brand competes with other well-known brands with similar historical pedigrees, including DeWalt, Ryobi, Makita, and Milwaukee. Based on perception from several tool reviews, we understand its considered a strong value, providing budget-friendly but professional-grade tools that are well designed and durable. The brand boasts a Net Promoter Score of 73, comparable to products made by Apple, which we think is evidence of the brands stickiness. Finally, we think modest switching costs exist with the Emersons tools for two reasons: Ridgid works with fitting companies for specific plumbing applications, and Emerson providers contractors technical training on its tools, which we think contributes to the brands high NPS.(Nov. 27, 2023): Previous versions of this report referred incorrectly to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration.","We think Emerson faces several risks, including its large exposure to oil and gas end markets. From 2014 to 2016, ROIC including goodwill fell nearly 4 points as the price of oil fell precipitously. Similarly, any slowdown in the global economy would have a disproportionate impact on Emersons business. Finally, Emerson could struggle to integrate some of its offerings and face some of the impairment charges it has faced in the past; however, given the prices paid for these businesses, we see this as a far less likely event. For example, Emerson paid about 12 times Aventics estimated 2018 EBITDA, according to Bloomberg, relative to the 18-20 times multiple to our 2018 EBITDA estimate for Rockwell (using Emersons first $210 to final $225 bids).Raw material inflation and tariffs are another risk, but we see it more of a right of the decimal concern thus far. Nonetheless, we think Emerson can offset some of its raw material costs through price increases and pass them on to customers (although this is less true in the short term in the commercial and residential solutions platform, from our understanding). Second, some equipment, like InSinkErator garbage disposals, has traditionally faced unreciprocated Chinese tariffs.From an environmental, social, and governance standpoint, we see several potential risks, including ongoing asbestos liabilities as well as potential safety recalls in Emerson's equipment. The largest ESG risk to Emerson's operations is carbon emission regulation, since a large part of the company's automation sales are made to the oil and gas end markets between upstream, midstream, and refinery exposure. Nonetheless, this impact is measured in all three of our scenarios, and we don't believe it's material, given that we expect many of Emerson's automation sales will increasingly shift to other process markets like chemicals, as well as power and renewables.","We assign Emerson Electric management a Standard Capital Allocation Rating. While we believe the balance sheet is strong and the firm's distributions are appropriate and shareholder-friendly, we're more neutral on its execution and future investments given the change in management, whose priorities we believe are still yet to be determined (including the future of the portfolio, for example).In February 2021, Emerson announced the retirement of CEO David Farr. Concurrent with the announcement, and in a surprise to no industry observers after the departure of Bob Sharp (formerly head of Emerson's commercial and residential solutions platform), Lal Karsanbhai was named CEO. Karsanbhai was formerly head of the automation solutions segment and is a 26-year veteran of the firm. Karsanbhai has remade the portfolio, primarily focusing on automation, but we think he could have gone further with a sale of Emerson's tools business, which bears little strategic rationale with the rest of the portfolio.Farr had been at the helm since 2000 and was only Emersons third CEO in 45 years. We think his tenure presented a very mixed capital allocation record. Farr deserved a great deal of credit for helping build Emersons automation business from a shadow of the global behemoth it is today. In some ways, we think this demonstrated better long-term thinking than his predecessor, who was more focused on quarterly earnings. In 1997, Farr was tasked with overseeing the firms process control business. At the time, Emerson was far behind other competitors and ranked about eighth or ninth globally in terms of the firms automation installed base. Today it boasts the one of the industrys largest installed bases, which the company built without a massive acquisition.That said, the firm made several large M&A blunders during his tenure, most notably in the former network power segment. Chloride was a 2010 acquisition for $1.5 billion that was meant to be a play on the growing data center space but lost ground as it became increasingly commoditized, faced competition from hyperscale offerings, and endured a slowdown in the European markets. Power supplier Artesyn Technologies was another poor acquisition under Farrs watch in 2006. Because of these purchases, from 2012 to 2014, Emerson was forced to take three goodwill-impairment charges (on a pretax basis) of $528 million in 2012, $496 million in 2013, and $508 million in 2014 as the carrying value of these businesses on Emersons books exceeded their respective fair market values. To his credit, Farr faced his mistake when he acknowledged he didnt want the network power business on his tombstone, and he divested the segment in November 2016. We're concerned that Emerson is repeating history under Karsanbhai by clearly overpaying for NI, following already sweetening two prior offers, even after fully incorporating the proposed cost synergies. We don't think the acquisition of AspenTech was particularly cheap either, even after considering synergies.Shareholder-friendly initiatives have come in the form of share buybacks during periods of undervaluation, and we support the proposed buyback of $500 million in fiscal 2024, given where the stock trades relative to our fair value estimate. Other shareholder-friendly initiatives include an annually increasing dividend streak thats been unbroken for nearly 70 years (which we expect should total $2.10 per share in fiscal 2024). In our view, Emerson deserves credit for managing its cash flow and keeping this streak unbroken.","Emerson Electric sells automation equipment and services under two segments: intelligent devices and software control. Within software and control, it also holds a majority interest in AspenTech, an industrial software business, and owns a test and measurement business that was formerly National Instruments. Intelligent devices also holds Emerson's tools business, which boasts several household brands, like Ridgid. Emerson's automation business is most known for its process manufacturing solutions, which consists of measurement and analytical instrumentation, as well as control valves and actuators, among other products and services. Nearly half of the firms geographic sales come from the Americas.","We think Emersons financial health is stable and leverage on the balance sheet compares favorably with that of other industrial companies. The firms credit rating is A2, indicating a low risk of default, which reasonably concurs with our model driven-assessment of very low. The debt/equity ratio as of the end of fiscal 2023 stands at about 0.4, a level we consider manageable. Portions of Emerson's debt have been used to finance its prior acquisitions, while other portions of debt have been used to finance share buybacks, which we've liked historically during periods of undervaluation.By the end of fiscal 2023, Emerson was in a net cash position. We believe this underpins the strength of the firms financial health. We anticipate that our full-year projected dividend of $2.10 is adequately covered at a payout ratio of 40% to our projected fiscal 2023 adjusted earnings on a continuing basis, which is near the upper end of what multi-industrials typically pay out in dividends."
14,22/02/2024,Returning to Historical Operating Margins Will Be Key to Lazards Valuation,Lazard Inc,LAZ,3,02/02/2024,Michael Wong,37.87,USD,21/02/2024,37.5,High,Narrow,Standard,B,02/02/2024,"Lazard ended a tough 2023 on a strong note, with the company positioning itself for what it hopes is the start of a long runway of growth. Lazard reported fourth-quarter net income to common shareholders of $64 million, or $0.65 per diluted share, on $806 million of net revenue. We were encouraged to see a swingin market sentiment during the quarter, which left revenue for the period 41% higher than the average of the prior three quarters. For the full year, net revenue was 9% lower than in 2022 and 21% lower than the peak annual levels in 2021. Lazard posted a net loss for the year of $75 million, but much of this was attributable to nearly $200 million of expenses tied to cost-saving initiatives. Company-provided adjusted net income for the year was positive $75 million, or $0.77 per diluted share. We dont anticipate making any significant changes to our $37.50 per share fair value estimate for narrow-moat Lazard and assess shares as fairly valued right now. New CEO Peter Orszag, who assumed the role in early October 2023, has set a growth strategy for the company that has a goal of adding 10 net new managing directors per year, intent on increasing managing director productivity to $10 million by 2028, as well as expanding its investment management capabilities. The growth focus of Lazard's peers in the previous economic cycle led to their outperformance relative to the firm, which was more conservative regarding adding headcount. Most investment banking heads have stated their expectations for gradual growth in 2024, which will likely be the start of a new mergers and acquisitions cycle. With this new growth strategy in place, Lazard's earnings should keep up with independent investment banking peers and could outperform the diversified investment banks, whose most recent trading revenue was closer to a peak than a trough. On Jan. 1, 2024, Lazard converted to a U.S. C-Corporation structure from a publicly traded partnership.","Lazard has the largest geographic footprint among financial advisory-focused investment banks and is in a strong position when global M&A accelerates. The company is well-recognized for its expertise in restructuring, which provides some counterbalance in a recession. A more growth-orientated mindset by management could improve the company's valuation. Changing to a C-Corporation could bring in new investors and demand for shares. Lazard has fairly well-scaled and profitable financial advisory and asset-management businesses, which is fairly unique among the investment banks.","While the company's restructuring revenue is countercyclical, the majority of its revenue being in merger advisory and asset management is procyclical. Lazard is arguably the most mature of the financial advisory-focused investment banks, so has a lower growth profile than peers. Management may not be able to deliver accelerating revenue growth and return to its historical operating margin. Changing to a C-Corp will increase the company's tax rate.",27/11/2023,"Lazards revenue will likely remain depressed into 2024, as it takes time for corporate confidence to recover and merger deals to close. Approximately 55% of Lazards net revenue is from acquisition and restructuring advisory, with the remaining 45% coming from institutional asset management. Given its relatively high exposure to EMEA and Asia (about 40% of net revenue), investors in Lazard have to pay attention to global developments. One potential positive is if the U.S. dollar weakens, as the tighter monetary policy in 2022 and 2023 caused a strengthening in the U.S. dollar that negatively affected earnings. The companys asset management business that specializes in global investing also gives it more exposure to international conditions. Lazards financial advisory revenue growth has underperformed peers for much of the previous decade, but this may change in the next several years. Lazard is a firm with over 175 years of history, and arguably its maturity contributed to its relatively slow growth. The company had around 150 managing directors in its advisory business in 2008 and didnt exceed 160 managing directors until 2018. Many of its younger peers heavily invested in their advisory business since the 2008 financial crisis and benefitted from the long economic expansion and upcycle in acquisitions activity. Lazards management has stated an intention to increase its managing director headcount and double revenue by 2030. A stronger growth trend to its managing director headcount and revenue could eventually cause investors to revalue the company higher.  The expansion of operating margins back to near historical levels is another important part of the company's valuation. Revenue mix and noncompensation costs are two factors that will need to be observed for signs of improvement. The companys asset-management segment has historically had better margins than its financial advisory segment; however, we forecast asset management declining to about 40% of total revenue from a peak closer to 50%. Noncompensation costs have also been elevated, and to improve margins the company will either have to lower these costs or keep them fixed as revenue grows.","Investment banking moats are primarily built on intangibles, which for an investment bank are in the strength of its reputation and relationships. For capital raising, merger advisory, and restructuring advisory, companies work with investment banks that have a history of successful pricing and execution of deals in their industry and with bankers with whom they have a trusted relationship. A benchmark of investment banking reputation is high placement in investment banking league tables. As for asset-management moats, they are largely a function of intangibles and switching costs. A strong asset-management brand is conducive to net inflows, and larger investors tend to stay invested with a current manager, rather than switching to a new manager with a similar strategy.We assign Lazard a Narrow Morningstar Economic Moat Rating due to its reputation, geographic reach, and relative diversification of its asset-management business. The company is a leading M&A and restructuring advisor that is often hired for the most complex assignments, such as Greece's sovereign debt situation in the Great Recession. Besides the tangible effect of the company's reputation shown via its role in high-profile financial advisory deals, its valuable intangible brand (built over 150 years) is also evident in the ability to recruit strong revenue-generating talenton average, Lazard's managing directors produced more than $8.5 million of advisory revenue annually over the past five years. The company's multilocal market expertise, stemming from its presence in over 40 cities across more than 25 countries, gives it a competitive advantage over smaller investment banks for cross-border M&A deals. Meanwhile, the company's business model, which doesn't include a significant capital markets segment, is distinguishable from other large global investment banks, as it has less potential for conflicts of interest with clients.We view the company's asset-management business as being relatively well diversified in terms of domestic and international equity strategies. However, the company doesn't have the diversity among asset classes, distribution channels, active versus passive, or niche strength that create the highest level of switching costs found in wide-moat asset managers.","Our primary concern in regard to Lazard is that we could enter an extended period of low economic growth and pessimism when the economy isn't sufficiently poor to lead to restructuring assignments, while at the same time, conditions are not positive enough for corporations to engage in mergers and acquisitions. A period of low economic growth could coincide with fewer organic growth opportunities for companies, leading them to try growing via acquisition, but this type of M&A activity probably won't be enough to prevent lackluster earnings. The company also has relatively large exposures to EMEA, so slower European growth or a recession would affect the company more than Americas-orientated peers.With regard to the company's asset-management business, Lazard's more global orientation has some more pronounced risk characteristics than U.S.-focused managers. With the U.S. economy often being on better footing than much of the rest of the globe, a scenario where the U.S. dollar strengthens would reduce reported assets under management.Lazard is a global investment bank and may operate in geographies with corruption and weak legal systems. This comes with ESG risks associated with increased litigation and regulatory cost. There have also been moves in recent years scrutinizing tax management strategies, and Lazard is incorporated in Bermuda and has a low corporate tax rate.Owing to the pressures affecting the asset management industry, the unknown length of this mergers and acquisitions cycle, currency fluctuations, and potential change in over-a-cycle managing director productivity, we assign a High Morningstar Uncertainty Rating to our fair value estimate for Lazard.","We give Lazard a Standard Morningstar Capital Allocation Rating. In our opinion, the company's balance sheet is sound, its capital investment decisions are fair, and its capital return strategy is appropriate. While the company has a somewhat high debt-to-equity ratio, it also has quite a bit of cash on its balance sheet, relatively steady earnings for an investment bank, and low capital needs. Therefore, we believe the company can service its debt. The company's capital investment decisions are fair, with Lazard predominately growing through internal investment. We assess the company's capital return strategy as appropriate. Lazard has occasionally used a special dividend to return cash to shareholders, which we view positively. Previous moves to decrease Lazard's excess cash balances by repurchasing shares, repurchasing debt, and increasing the dividend show an even greater emphasis on returning value to shareholders in the past several years. The company has also occasionally been fairly active with its capital return policy, decreasing its special dividend in 2019 to repurchase more shares and aggressively repurchasing shares in 2022. While the company has returned more capital to shareholders in recent years, it may still have hundreds of millions in excess capital and cash on its balance sheet.Peter Orszag became CEO of Lazard in 2023, succeeding Kenneth Jacobs. Orszag has laid out a goal of delivering annual total shareholder returns of 10%-15% and doubling revenue by 2030. Disclosed plans to achieve these goals include hiring more managing directors, increasing employee productivity, improving asset-management distribution, and acquiring emerging asset managers. Advisory firms that hired aggressively in the past decade generally did well. However, the past decade benefited from low interest rates, while the next decade will likely have relatively higher interest rates and increased geopolitical uncertainty. For the moment, we're rather skeptical of revenue doubling.","Lazard has a storied history that can be traced back to 1848. The company's revenue is nearly equally split between financial advisory, such as acquisition and restructuring advisory, and asset management. The company's asset management business is primarily equities (over 80% of assets under management), has an international focus, and is geared toward institutional clients. By geography, the company earns approximately 60% of revenue in the Americas, 35% in EMEA, and 5% in Asia-Pacific. Lazard has offices across more than 20 countries and over 3,000 employees.","Lazard has a relatively high debt/equity ratio, but we believe it is in fine financial health. The company has consistently healthy cash flows from operations and most of the company's debt doesn't mature until 2025 or later. At the end of 2022, the company had approximately $1.7 billion of debt. The earliest maturity is $400 million in 2025. At the end of 2022, the company had $1.2 billion of cash and equivalents on its balance sheet. Due to the company being in financial advisory and asset management and not having significant exposure to capital-intensive business lines such as traditional banking or trading, the company is a strong cash generator that can return much of its earnings to shareholders via dividends and repurchases."
15,22/02/2024,PPG Faces Moderating Demand but Input Cost Improvements Should Benefit Margins,PPG Industries Inc,PPG,2,19/01/2024,Spencer Liberman,142.65,USD,21/02/2024,117.0,Medium,Narrow,Standard,A,19/01/2024,"Narrow-moat PPG capped off a strong year with solid fourth-quarter results that were largely in line with our expectations. PPG navigated a challenging year when higher interest rates constrained its architectural coatings business and tepid industrial production hampered its industrial coatings segment. That said, PPG was able to largely offset this through strength in aerospace, automotive OEM (original equipment manufacturing), and protective coatings, while moderating input costs and higher selling prices drove margin expansion. While interest-rate headwinds are likely to persist for much of 2024, we think continued strength from aerospace, automotive refinish, and PPGs Mexico business will lead to low mid-single-digit revenue growth and improved earnings. As such, we have maintained our $117 fair value estimate. PPGs performance segment finished the year on a high note, with net sales increasing 5% year over year and reporting a 150-basis-point increase in operating margins to almost 12.5%. Volumes were roughly flat compared with a year ago, but pricing gains and favorable currency translation drove growth. While architectural coatings in North America remained challenged, PPG continues to experience strong demand in aerospace, automotive refinish, and protective. Looking ahead, we expect some relief in 2024 for PPGs architectural business, but interest rates and soft existing-home sales will likely constrain volume growth. The industrial coatings business reported solid results despite weakness in its industrial and packaging end markets. Net sales rose 2.5% in the fourth quarter compared with a year ago, but the segment reported an impressive 400-basis-point increase in its operating margin. Automotive OEM once again buoyed the segment as global auto production continued to recover. While its unlikely automotive OEM will drive similar growth in 2024, we expect improvements in industrial and packaging will support the the performance coatings segment.","The company operates in a diverse range of end markets, leading to stable earnings even during industry-specific slowdowns. Consolidation has characterized the coating industry during the past decade, and PPG can capture additional share as consolidation continues. PPGs expanded partnership with Home Depot increases its professional paint line at the retailer. This strategy could increase PPGs market share in the professional paint market. ","PPG has a focus on the lower-margin and highly competitive industrial coatings market. Its architectural business is only a third of total revenue.  Despite a diversified customer base, PPG's profitability is not immune to economic slowdowns, as seen in 2008 and 2009, when operating margin dropped below 10% for the first time in a decade. PPGs push into the North American professional paint market will face stiff competition and is unlikely to take market share from wide-moat Sherwin Williams. ",19/01/2024,"PPG Industries is a globally diversified producer of paints and coatings. The company is the world's largest producer of coatings after the purchase of selected Akzo Nobel assets. PPG's products are sold to a wide variety of end users, including the automotive, aerospace, construction, and industrial markets. The company has a footprint in many regions around the globe, with less than half of sales coming from North America in recent years. PPG is focused on growing its coatings and specialty product offerings and expanding into emerging regions, as exemplified by the Comex acquisition. PPG is organized into two segments, performance coatings and industrial coatings. Performance coatings (60% of sales) supplies architectural, aerospace, and protective coatings that are generally sold after the manufacturing of the underlying good. Architectural coatings make up roughly half of the segment, with PPGs products usually on the lower end of the value chain. Recently, PPG announced it has expanded its partnership with Home Depot. This expansion should increase the firms exposure to the architectural market in North America. The industrial coatings segment (40% of sales) supplies coatings used in auto, packaging, metals, and industrial equipment manufacturing. The company generates more than $18 billion in sales each year, growing at GDP-like rates. To supplement growth, the firm has been a serial acquirer of relatively small bolt-on businesses. It typically looks for coatings technologies that it doesn't currently have, with the intent to scale the production of that new offering across its facilities worldwide. The global coatings industry is highly fragmented, which should keep this strategy viable for the foreseeable future. That said, we generally dislike acquisition-dependent strategies due to the heightened risk of shareholder value destruction. ","We think PPG benefits from durable competitive advantages that should support economic profits for at least the next 10 years. We assign PPG a narrow moat rating based on its intangible assets and switching costs. The company participates in most architectural paint markets while also selling into industrial end markets such as new autos, refinish and collision, packaging, and aerospace. This diversity makes it hard for the company to materially under- or outperform the broader coatings space, given the relatively small contribution each business makes on its own. Within the company's performance coatings segment (61% of sales), architectural coatings account for roughly half of the segments revenue. In the architectural market, PPG is known as the lower cost alternative to premium suppliers like Sherwin-Williams and Behr. PPG sells its architectural coatings through its partnership with Home Depot, other regional and national retail outlets, and through its network of roughly 800 company owned retail stores (a comparatively small footprint relative to Sherwin's 5,000 stores). The remaining half of the performance coatings segment is in aerospace, and automotive refinish, and protective coatings that are generally sold after the manufacture of the underlying good. Many of these products are sold direct to consumer and through company-owned or independent distribution networks.The industrial coatings segment accounts for the remaining 39% of PPG's sales and are generally applied to products during manufacturing. These paints and coatings are sold direct to the manufacturer and are usually specifically formulated to meet the clients needs. This dynamic creates a stickiness that is not obtained in the architectural paint market.While PPG might not have the same brand recognition and reputation as Sherwin-Williams, we think PPGs brand commands enough pricing power to support an intangible asset moat source. From architectural to industrial applications, PPG is a globally recognized brand. In the architectural market, PPG offers a lower cost alternative that still delivers quality results for both amateur and professional painters. For amateur painters, the low-cost nature of PPGs consumer focused paint lines has made them a favorite for consumers looking to paint on a budget. Many of these consumers are working on one-time small projects, so they are less concerned about overall paint quality and application efficiency compared with professional painters.As compared with its peer Sherwin-Williams, we believe PPG is less advantaged in architectural coatings, especially in the professional paint market. PPG has built out a network of roughly 800 stores in North America, well behind the 5,000-plus Sherwin-Williams stores. For professional painters, retail stores provide a convenient and consistent way to purchase paint and supplies. The lack of scale of PPGs retail stores and lower paint quality inhibits the firms ability to compete with Sherwin-Williams in the professional market. Nevertheless, PPGs lines of professional and amateur architectural paint are sold in all Home Depot stores, alongside the premium Behr brand. PPGs Home Depot lineup was expanded in 2022 to include more paint products designed for professional painters. This partnership provides PPG with an additional avenue to sell its products, but we dont think this will be enough to materially capture share of the professional paint market. PPGs industrial coatings products are usually applied in a manufacturing setting before a product is completed and sold. This includes OEMs across automotive, packaging, construction equipment, consumer electronics, and more. Many of the products sold in the industrials coating segment are specifically formulated for the customer. These customers are stickier than those purchasing architectural coatings as the products are far less commoditized. Given that coating is generally embedded as a step within the broader production process, factors like dry time, cure time, and abrasion resistance can affect the pace or process throughout the remainder of assembly. Accordingly, a coating switch has costly implications for only a marginal savings per unit. Many manufacturing facilities operate at high efficiencies to maintain output and margins. Downtime related to switching coatings and potentially replacing specialized equipment is a large deterrent for most firms.","We assign PPG a Medium Morningstar Uncertainty Rating. From a fundamental perspective, we believe a potential slowdown in global GDP growth elevates the company's risk profile. PPG has diverse geographic exposure and operates in a wide array of end markets, ranging from architectural to highly specialized industrial applications. PPG has historically grown at GDP-like rates, and the firm tends to move with the global economic cycle. Coatings companies can experience considerable margin compression during a downturn, especially if the housing market weakens considerably. PPGs acquisition strategy puts the firm at an additional risk. The success of future acquisitions is uncertain, and a variety of factors, such as unfavorable deal terms, integration issues, and subsequent acquisition underperformance, could destroy shareholder value. The company's profit margins are also affected by oil and titanium dioxide price volatility. Rising input costs can strain margins, and it can take time before the company can pass on commensurate price increases.PPG is exposed to a couple of environmental, social, and governance risks, including environmental and social impact of the firm's products and services and carbon emissions from the firm's operation. However, we don't believe these risks could result in material value destruction. PPG has a history of developing environmentally friendly products and has grown its portfolio of environmentally friendly products. Over 35% of sales are generated from sustainable products and services, representing roughly $5 billion of sales. The firm also receives approximately 21% of its electricity from renewable sources. We expect the firm's product leadership and its commitment to environmentally friendly products and lower carbon emissions to continue.","We assign PPG a Standard Capital Allocation Rating. This rating reflects our forward-looking assessments of the firm's financial health, investment strategy and efficacy (both organic and inorganic), and shareholder distribution policy. Our Standard rating is a function of our sound balance sheet, satisfactory investments, and appropriate shareholder distribution ratings.PPGs balance sheet is sound, in our view. We believe the firm's leverage is reasonable considering its stable profitability and strong free cash flow generation. While leverage has increased in recent years, the company has kept its net debt/adjusted EBITDA below 2.5 for the last decade, and management remains committed to maintaining an investment-grade debt rating. We view PPGs investment strategy as satisfactory. The firm's acquisition strategy has boosted its growth prospects and expanded its end markets. While none of PPG's major deals strike us as highly value-dilutive, academic evidence historically suggests that M&A tends to cede most of its benefits to the seller. The success of future acquisitions is uncertain, and a variety of factors--such as unfavorable deal terms, integration issues, and subsequent acquisition underperformance--could destroy shareholder value. Nevertheless, we expect PPGs returns on invested capital to sit well above its weighted average cost of capital.We believe PPGs shareholder distributions are appropriate. The firms acquisition strategy requires significant capital, which can hinder its ability to distribute cash to shareholders. That said, PPG has consistently paid a dividend with steady annual increases. The firm tends to repurchase shares at a lesser rate than its peers. When the firm does repurchase shares, we believe it does so at acceptable prices.","PPG is a global producer of coatings. The company is the world's largest producer of coatings after the purchase of selected Akzo Nobel assets. PPG's products are sold to a wide variety of end users, including the automotive, aerospace, construction, and industrial markets. The company has a footprint in many regions around the globe, with less than half of sales coming from North America in recent years. PPG is focused on its coatings and specialty products and expansion into emerging regions, as exemplified by the Comex acquisition.","We think PPG has a sound capital structure, and its consistent free cash flow generation should easily support its debt-service requirements and future capital-allocation decisions. Given PPGs acquisitive strategy, liquidity is an important metric to monitor. PPG has managed its leverage well, keeping net debt/adjusted EBITDA below 2.5 over the last 10 years. While management has no explicit long-term leverage targets, we expect the company will maintain an investment-grade rating on its debt. PPG has roughly $5.7 billion of outstanding debt with staggered maturities through 2044. PPG has ample liquidity, with over $1 billion of cash on hand and no outstanding borrowings on a $2.2 billion credit facility. PPG has a history of strong free cash flow generation, and we expect the company to maintain its sound capital structure."
16,22/02/2024,Southern Benefits From Growing Southeast U.S. Energy Demand,Southern Co,SO,3,15/02/2024,Travis Miller,67.73,USD,21/02/2024,69.0,Low,Narrow,Exemplary,B,15/02/2024,"We are reaffirming our $69 fair value estimate for Southern after the company reported $3.65 per share of operating earnings in 2023, up from $3.60 in 2022 and slightly higher than our estimate. On a weather-adjusted basis, earnings were up 6%, in line with our outlook and management's 5%-7% annual growth target. We are reaffirming our narrow moat rating. We expect similar earnings growth to continue for at least the next few years based on energy demand growth in Southern's southeast service territories, constructive regulation, and robust capital investment. Management's $3.95-$4.05 EPS guidance range for 2024 implies another year of 6% growth on a weather-normalized basis. Southern added $5 billion, or 12%, to its five-year capital investment plan now totaling $48 billion. This is slightly higher than we expected but not enough to have a material impact on our fair value estimate. We expect actual investment to be higher, especially in the outer years as Southern adds projects to serve new demand. Southern's challenge is managing what could be one of the highest energy demand growth rates in the U.S. Management now expects 9% average annual electricity demand growth in its core Georgia service territory beyond 2025 and 6% average annual electricity demand across its entire three-state system. Southern's 4% dividend yield is above the sector median, but we expect only 3% annual dividend growth for several more years until Southern's payout ratio falls to near 60%. We expect the board to approve an $0.08 per share, or 3% annualized dividend increase next quarter, representing a 70% payout ratio. New Vogtle nuclear unit 4 is scheduled to enter service in April, consistent with management's update last quarter. There was no change to management's $10.75 billion total project cost estimate with an estimated $189 million remaining investment. Run-rate earnings and cash flow should step up once the project enters service.","Southern has excellent regulatory relationships due in large part to low utility rates and solid reliability. Although operational performance is the foundation for these relationships, management maintains strong political ties as well. Cash flow should increase now that the Vogtle project is complete, supporting a stronger balance sheet and faster dividend growth. Business investment and customer growth remains strong in Southern's primary Southeast U.S. service territory, supporting growing energy demand.","Cost overruns at Vogtle and Kemper have added uncertainty to Southern's excellent regulatory relationships and frameworks in Georgia and Mississippi. A change in the constructive ratemaking structures in Georgia, Alabama, and Mississippi could lead Southern to reduce its $43 billion five-year capital investment plan. Energy efficiency is reducing sales growth, and we expect this trend to continue in the next decade.",23/01/2024,"Southern is in the process of a dramatic clean energy transformation. Its $43 billion capital investment plan during the next five years will reduce greenhouse gas emissions, expand renewable energy, strengthen the gas system, and support the Southeast region's fast-growing energy demand. In 2000, almost 80% of the electricity Southern sold was generated using coal. That share is now below 20% and falling. The company is aiming to retire all but eight coal plants by 2028 and reach net-zero carbon emissions from power generation by 2050. Nuclear, natural gas, and renewable energy are all increasing their share of generation. The transformation has had hiccups, notably the construction delays and cost overruns at the new Vogtle nuclear units 3 and 4. The units are five years behind schedule and more than double the initial cost estimate, but the project is nearly complete. Unit 3 went online in late 2023, and unit 4 is scheduled to begin operations soon. Vogtle's total capital cost is now set to top $23 billion, with Georgia Power's 45.7% share approximately $10.7 billion net of a $1.7 billion settlement payment from Toshiba, which declared bankruptcy in 2017 in part due to the project's financial challenges. Other setbacks with Southern's transformation were the delays and cost overruns at the Kemper (Mississippi) project, a planned first-of-its-kind lignite coal-to-gas combined-cycle plant with carbon capture. The project fell three years behind schedule and the budget doubled before Southern decided to run it as a traditional gas plant and take a write-off of roughly $6 billion pretax. Although these two projects have stolen headlines and impaired shareholder value, Southern has a long history of solid execution across its businesses. With a renewed focus on smaller projects, we think Southern can produce steady 6% earnings growth. Dividend growth has trailed earnings growth in recent years because of Southern's large investments, but we expect dividend growth to accelerate and match earnings growth starting in 2024 when Vogtle is finished.","We believe Southern has a narrow moat supported by its state-regulated utilities, which represent approximately 90% of its earnings. Service territory monopolies and efficient scale advantages are the primary moat sources for Southern's regulated utilities.State and federal regulators grant Southern exclusive rights to charge customers rates that allow it to earn a fair return on and return of the capital it invests to build, operate, and maintain their infrastructure. In exchange for Southern's service territory monopolies, state and federal regulators set returns at levels that aim to minimize customer costs while offering fair returns for capital providers. We expect returns on invested capital to remain at a modest but consistent spread above Southern's cost of capital for the foreseeable future, supporting our narrow moat rating.This implicit contract between regulators and capital providers should, on balance, allow Southern's utilities to achieve at least their costs of capital, though observable returns might vary in the short run based on demand trends, investment cycles, operating costs, and access to financing.Southern benefits from favorable regulatory environments and fastest-growing local economies in most of its service territories. These factors contribute to the premium returns Southern has earned and its constructive relationships with regulators, the most critical component of a regulated utility's moat.The investment opportunities and regulatory mechanisms that have allowed Southern to earn its best-in-class returns on equity are in large part because of the company's constructive relationships with state regulators in Alabama, Georgia, and Mississippi.Southern will have to prove it can build constructive regulatory relationships in states with more challenging regulation such as Illinois following its acquisition of AGL. The delays and cost overruns at the Kemper and Vogtle projects have weighed on earned returns for nearly a decade, but we think those headwinds will be over by mid-2024.Southern's competitive generation business benefits from long-term contracts that lock in favorable returns for capacity and energy. Its average contract length is over 10 years and it takes little direct commodity risk.","Our Morningstar Uncertainty Rating for Southern is Low.We forecast 6% average annual earnings growth now that the new Vogtle nuclear project is nearly complete. We don't anticipate any significant additional cost overruns as unit 4 enters service. Southern received what we considered a constructive ruling from Georgia regulators in late 2023 that locks in Southern's return on and return of its Vogtle investment.Possible environmental legislation and other fossil-fuel regulations are long-term uncertainties, but Southern's investment plan is meant to reduce that environmental risk. The company aims to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.Environmental compliance requirements could prove to be less painful to shareholders than some might expect and could actually boost earnings if new regulations lead to additional growth investment opportunities. Achieving Southern's carbon emissions reduction goals will require regulatory support for coal plant closures and new renewable energy.The biggest threat that Southern faces is a deterioration of regulatory relationships in its three retail electric service territories. Much of the company's success hinges on the relationships it has built through years by providing low-cost, reliable electric service. This topnotch operational performance and the constructive regulatory relationships should protect shareholders from any major regulatory setbacks that might impair shareholder value.","We assign Southern an Exemplary Capital Allocation Rating due in large part to management's plan to invest in rate-regulated projects that have strong regulatory support and promote clean energy growth.With the Vogtle and Kemper setbacks behind them, we are confident that management will allocate capital prudently and maintain constructive relationships with many stakeholders, from regulators to customers. Management remains focused on constructive relationships with state regulators, which is a crucial driver of utilities' earned returns over the long run.We believe Southern's strong leadership was evident while managing the Westinghouse bankruptcy and persuading Vogtle's partners, regulators, and other government leaders to finish the project. We believe management's response to the Kemper and Vogtle problems demonstrates a strong commitment to prudent capital allocation.CEO Chris Womack replaced retiring CEO Thomas Fanning in March 2023. Womack has continued the decarbonization strategy that Fanning championed, positioning Southern for a long runway of growth. Womack's experience in a variety of roles since joining Southern in 1988 should help him maintain constructive relationships with many stakeholders, a hallmark of Southern's value proposition for shareholders.Fanning leaves with a mixed record as CEO since late 2010. He oversaw two of the industry's largest and most ambitious projects in several decadesthe Kemper (Mississippi) coal gasification plant and two new units at the Vogtle (Georgia) nuclear plant. However, each project ran into financial and operational challenges that ultimately led to large shareholder losses. Southern shareholders realized a 220% return, including dividends, with Fanning as CEO, trailing the 240% total return of the Morningstar US Utilities Sector Index during the same time period.","Southern is one of the largest utilities in the U.S. The company serves 9 million customers with vertically integrated electric utilities in three states and natural gas distribution utilities in four states. It owns 50 gigawatts of rate-regulated generating capacity, primarily for serving customers in Georgia, Alabama, and Mississippi. Subsidiary Southern Power owns 13 gigawatts of natural gas generation and renewable energy across the U.S. and sells the electricity primarily under long-term contracts.","Southern has stabilized its balance sheet. We expect the company's credit metrics will continue to improve as the Vogtle project wraps up. Investors should benefit from a jump in cash flow as Southern incorporates its full Vogtle investment into customer rates this year.The AGL acquisition and Kemper write-downs increased debt/capital to over 67% at 2017 year-end versus 57% in 2015. Asset sales and equity issuances since then have helped Southern improve its balance sheet. We still think Southern can operate with slightly higher leverage than its peers because of its constructive regulatory frameworks.Southern's dividend growth has averaged just 3% annually for the last 10 years, slower than many of its peers' dividend growth. We forecast a 70% payout ratio in 2024 based on an $0.08 per share, or 3%, annualized dividend increase. This is slightly higher than other utilities' payout ratios and could limit dividend growth in 2024-25. We expect dividend growth to accelerate beyond 2025 as earnings growth picks up and cash flow increases following the completion of the new Vogtle units."
17,22/02/2024,Sherwin-Williams Benefits From Resilient Architectural Paint Market and Moderating Material Costs,Sherwin-Williams Co,SHW,1,26/01/2024,Spencer Liberman,314.29,USD,21/02/2024,214.0,Medium,Wide,Exemplary,A,26/01/2024,"Wide-moat Sherwin-Williams reported solid fourth-quarter results that came with few surprises. Sherwins paint stores group continued to perform well as residential repaint drove volume growth in the quarter. While architectural paint markets remained constrained due to a slowdown in new and existing home sales in 2023, we expect improvements in 2024, driven by residential repaint and new residential construction. We are maintaining our fair value estimate of $214 per share. The paint stores group was the bright spot for Sherwin during the quarter as the segment reported a 2% increase in sales year over year and margins expanded 200 basis points to 19.3%. The segment benefited from higher volumes and moderating raw material costs in the quarter. Expectedly, new residential and do-it-yourself, or DIY, were the laggards in the quarter, but this was more than offset by strength in residential repaint, commercial, and protective. Additionally, Sherwin announced a 5% price increase that will be effective Feb. 1 for the paint stores group, which management noted is in response to higher wages and non-raw material costs. We think this price increase will provide a runway for margin expansion in the paint stores group in 2024 while volumes should be buoyed by strength in residential repaint. Sherwins performance coatings group reported mixed results for the quarter, with revenue roughly flat year over year as lower volumes were largely offset by acquisitions and favorable currency translation. That said, moderating raw materials costs led to an almost 400-basis-point increase in operating margin despite higher selling costs. While automotive refinish and industrial wood performed well in the quarter, packaging continued to weigh on the segment. Nevertheless, we expect inventory destocking activity to moderate in 2024, which should provide a boost to Sherwins packaging coatings business.","Professional painters have favored Sherwin products for decades, leading to strong brand loyalty and pricing power. New residential construction and increased rental properties should provide strong tailwinds for residential coatings growth. The exclusive partnership with Lowes creates an additional avenue for Sherwin to sell its products to new customers without meaningful cannibalization risk.","Residential repainting surged during the COVID-19 pandemic, which could result in a near-term glut. The company's margins are sensitive to raw material prices. Higher titanium dioxide or petrochemical prices could lead to margin contraction if Sherwin is not able to pass along those costs to customers. Sherwin has continued to open roughly 100 company-owned stores per year, but saturation could become a concern. If fewer stores are opened, overall growth could slow.",26/01/2024,"Sherwin-Williams is the largest provider of architectural paint in the United States. The firm has over 5,000 stores and sells premium paint at higher price points than most competitors. Sherwin-Williams also sells its products in big-box stores and provides coatings for original equipment manufacturers. More than three fourths of Sherwin's business occurs in North America, with much of its international exposure acquired during the 2016 purchase of Valspar. The acquisition of Valspar has bolstered its previously modest retail presence, as Valspars long-standing relationship with Lowes led to an exclusive partnership for Sherwin in 2018. Sherwin also obtained Valspars industrial business, expanding its performance coatings segment.  In Sherwin's largest segment, the paint stores group, it has maintained strong growth, even in developed markets, as it rolls out nearly 100 new stores every year throughout the Americas. Its strategic focus on building this segment has created a strong value proposition for contractors. Job site delivery, in-app ordering, and a capacity for high-volume orders save time for customers and allows for premium product pricing. Roughly 90% of sales in the paint stores group are to professional painters with the remaining 10% to do-it-yourself consumers.  The consumer brands segment markets Sherwin's paint brands through retail channels, such as Menards, and is the exclusive provider of coating products to Lowe's. It owns a variety of widely known brands such as Valspar, Purdy, Minwax, Krylon, Thompson's WaterSeal, and Dutch Boy. The performance coatings business produces a diverse product mix and accounts for much of the company's global exposure. The segment sells everything from marine paints to airplane and fire-resistant coatings, many of which are custom-formulated to suit client needs.","We think Sherwin-Williams benefits from durable competitive advantages that should support economic profits for at least the next 20 years. We assign Sherwin a wide moat rating based on its intangible assets. The paint stores group and consumer brands segments (accounting for more than 75% of segment EBIT) enjoy strong brand equity, which has supported durable pricing power. While the performance coatings segment benefits from switching costs, we give it a narrow moat as we do not think its pricing power is as durable as the company's other segments. The segment does not represent a large enough percentage of the consolidated portfolio to warrant extending the switching cost moat source to the firm. That said, Sherwin's wide-moat segments (the paint stores group and consumers brands business) account for most of the firm's profits, leading to our wide-moat rating for Sherwin-Williams. Sherwin-Williams is one of the most trusted brands in the residential paint industry, producing high quality products sold at premium prices. Following its 2016 acquisition of Valspar, Sherwin became the worlds largest paint and coatings producer. Of the four largest paint companies, Sherwin has a dominant position in the North American professional paint market and solid DIY exposure. In the U.S architectural paint market, professional paint makes up roughly 60% of sales while DIY accounts for about 40%. Sherwin reaches the professional market through its vast network of retail stores, and the firm leverages its Lowe's partnership to reach DIY painters that prefer the big box format. Professional painters have strong preferences based on quality, ease of use, and availability. Additionally, professional painters are much less price sensitive as 80%-90% of their costs are labor while only 10%-20% are for materials. Many trust the quality of the Sherwin brand and are willing to pay more for its products. Sherwin-Williams paint is well known in the industry for having desirable characteristics, including coverage (fewer coats needed), durability (lasts longer), cure time (less waiting time), and ease of application. For interior paints, Sherwins quality typically ranks similarly to two of its largest competitors (Behr and Benjamin Moore). When looking at exterior paints and stains, Sherwin ranks substantially higher than most competitors. Exterior paint jobs are usually done by professionals due to the size of the job and need for specialized equipment. These professional painters are willing to pay more for quality paints that make their jobs easier. This dynamic provides strong pricing power for Sherwin in the professional space. While there are competitors that produce quality paints at similar or lower prices, Sherwin can leverage its trusted brand and convenient retail network to retain and add professional painters to its network.The paint stores group operates almost 4,700 specialty paint stores in North and South America. The consumer brands group supplies Sherwins retail stores and other retailers and distributors with a broad portfolio of products. The retail stores are a key part of Sherwins operating model as they make purchasing supplies for professional painters convenient and consistent. The firm's vast retail footprint means that professional painters are never far from a store where they can purchase the same Sherwin products they have relied on for years. Professional painters prefer suppliers that allow them to be as efficient as possible with their time. Sherwin's management training system and concentrated focus on customer service has created a portfolio of pro-painter benefits that have long been unmatched. Mobile and web ordering platforms, a volume rewards program, extremely high-quality products, and optional job-site product delivery are designed to make contractors dependent on Sherwin-Williams. Sherwins retail store footprint supports the firms strong brand as it makes the procurement and purchasing of paint convenient for professional and amateur painters. Sherwin has strong relationships in the paint and coatings industry, including an exclusive partnership with Lowes to sell its paints and coatings. This partnership provides Sherwin with an additional avenue to sell its products to customers who prefer to shop in big-box retailers. While there is concern the Lowes partnership could cannibalize sales from Sherwins company owned stores, the products sold through Lowes target DIY customers rather than the professional painters who purchase from Sherwins retail stores. Additionally, 18 of the top 20 homebuilders and 17 of the top 20 property management companies partner exclusively with Sherwin Williams for coating supplies. While new residential construction is only a part of Sherwins business, its a testament to the companys deep ties in the professional paint market. Sherwins performance coatings segment (approximately 30% of revenue) sells everything from marine paints to airplane and fire-resistant coatings. Sherwin materially increased its industrial exposure with its 2016 acquisition of Valspar. The acquisition also increased Sherwins exposure to EMEA and the Asia-Pacific region. In our view, the Sherwin brand has less pricing power in the industrial space than the architectural market. There is much more competition in the global industrial coatings market compared with North American architectural. That said, some industrial coatings and coatings applications are developed specially to meet clients' product needs. Given that coating is generally embedded as a step within the broader production process, factors like dry time, cure time, and abrasion resistance can affect the pace or process throughout the remainder of assembly. In some cases, specialized equipment and processes are required to apply the coating. Because of this, a coating switch has costly implications for only marginal savings per unit. This dynamic causes a stickiness in the industrial business that is not enjoyed in the architectural market.","We assign Sherwin-Williams a Medium Morningstar Uncertainty Rating. The most substantial risk we see is a prolonged downturn in residential and commercial construction and residential repaint. While construction is more cyclical than repaint, both would be affected during a downturn and weaken the companys overall financial performance. Still, we think Sherwin has a durable business model and should be able to generate returns above its cost of capital, even in a downturn.Sherwin owns its retail stores, controlling all aspects of pricing and distribution. That said, high operating costs associated with this ownership model expose the company to risk. If sales were to decline, Sherwin would still have to pay the operating costs of its vast retail footprint, which would weigh on returns on invested capital. Sherwins acquisition of Valspar in 2016 for roughly $9 billion was its most significant acquisition. While it increased the company's exposure to the less-moaty industrial coatings business, the acquisition increased Sherwins architectural market share and led to its exclusive partnership with Lowes. After the company faced antitrust scrutiny for its acquisition of Valspar, we expect any future deals will be modest. Sherwin-Williams is exposed to some environmental, social, and governance risks, including environmental and social impact of its products and services and carbon emissions from its operations. However, we don't believe these risks could result in material value destruction. Regulations around chemicals have increased in recent years, but Sherwin has a long history of developing innovative products that reduce its overall environmental impact. Over 30% of the firms products are considered environmentally advantaged, and it has reduced its carbon emissions nearly 17% since 2017. We expect the firm's product leadership and its commitment to environmentally friendly products and lower carbon emissions to continue.","We assign Sherwin-Williams an Exemplary Capital Allocation Rating. This reflects our forward-looking assessments of the firm's financial health, investment strategy and efficacy (both organic and inorganic), and shareholder distribution policy. Our Exemplary rating is a function of our sound balance sheet, exceptional investments, and mixed shareholder distribution ratings.Sherwins balance sheet is sound, in our view. We believe the company's leverage is reasonable considering its stable profitability and solid free cash flow generation. Management has made positive strides in reducing its leverage following its acquisition of Valspar and we expect this trend will continue. We view Sherwin-Williams' investment strategy as exceptional. As the largest player in the North American paint market, the firm continues to successfully expand its store footprint and has gained market share both organically and inorganically. In our view, Sherwin-Williams has executed well on improving its value proposition to the pro painter customer base that relies on its North American store network. Perhaps partially attributable to luck, management's focus on U.S. architectural paints has also played into a few key trends. More households renting and an increasing preference to hire painters has supported volume, in contrast to less compelling volume growth for industrial coatings in North America. We expect management will continue to capitalize on attractive reinvestment opportunities through store expansion and bolt-on acquisitions. We also see appropriate reinvestment in product innovation, marketing, and distribution that will support the firms ability to maintain its significant market share in North America. We see Sherwins shareholder distributions as mixed. Management is committed to returning cash to shareholders, which is done through both dividends and share repurchases. While the company is considered a dividend aristocrat with over two decades of dividend growth, we see its share buybacks as somewhat dilutive, as the firm has routinely purchased stock at prices above our fair value estimate. We expect sizable shareholder distributions going forward as Sherwin continues to generate solid free cash flow.Sherwin-Williams announced that Heidi Petz will assume the role of CEO on Jan. 1, 2024, and current CEO John Morikis will serve as executive chairman of the company. Petz currently serves as the companys president and chief operating officer, a role Petz has held for the past two years. Petz joined Sherwin-Williams in 2017 through the Valspar acquisition and has served as the president of the consumer brands group at Sherwin and president of the Americas group prior to becoming COO in March 2022. This announcement is not surprising given Sherwins history of succession planning, and we do not expect material change in the companys strategy, considering Petz most recently served as the companys COO. Sherwin has executed its strategy well for years as it positioned its stores across the U.S to serve professional painters who are willing to pay more for high-quality paint that was readily available. Petz oversaw this operation when she was president of the Americas group, and we expect a continued focus on the North American professional paint market and strategic store expansion.","Sherwin-Williams is the largest provider of architectural paint in the United States. The company has over 5,000 stores and sells premium paint at higher price points than most competitors. Sherwin-Williams also sells paint-related products in big-box stores and provides coatings for original equipment manufacturers.","We think Sherwin-Williams has a sound capital structure, and its consistent free cash flow generation should easily support its debt service requirements and future capital allocation decisions. Leverage increased following the 2016 acquisition of Valspar. Management has made progress in reducing debt, with net debt/adjusted EBITDA coming down to below 3.0 from 4.5 in 2017. Following Sherwins acquisition of Valspar and PPGs 2018 acquisition of Comex, there are few North American paint companies that could be potential acquisition targets for Sherwin. We dont anticipate Sherwin will make any sizable acquisitions in the near future as the company focuses on its retail stores and Lowes partnership. Sherwin leverages its commercial paper program and credit facilities to fund a portion of its working capital and expenses. Because of this, the firm usually has less than $250 million of cash on hand. The firm has roughly $8.5 billion in outstanding debt with staggered maturities through 2052, but its next maturity isnt until 2024 when roughly $1 billion is due. Sherwin-Williams has a history of strong free cash flow generation, even in a downturn, which demonstrates the durability of its business model."
18,22/02/2024,Martin Marietta Navigates Soft Residential Construction but Price Growth Provides Near-Term Relief ,Martin Marietta Materials Inc,MLM,1,14/02/2024,Spencer Liberman,536.3,USD,21/02/2024,350.0,Medium,Narrow,Exemplary,A,14/02/2024,"Narrow-moat-rated Martin Marietta reported solid fourth-quarter results that capped off a strong year for the company. Martin Marietta continues to flex its pricing power across its portfolio as all four segments experienced selling price growth. Conversely, shipments were down in the quarter from a year ago for three of its four core segments as Martin Marietta navigates moderating end-market demand. Martin Mariettas focus on value over volume continues to bear fruit for the firm and management has shown no sign of letting up on pricing actions. While we expect shipments to face headwinds for much of 2024, we expect this will largely be offset by additional pricing gains during the year. As such, we have increased our fair value estimate to $350 from $330 per share. Martin Mariettas aggregates business reported strong results despite demand headwinds that persisted through the fourth quarter. Net sales rose 9.5% as a 2% decline in shipments was offset by a 15% increase in selling prices during the quarter. Segment gross margin expanded over 600 basis points to 32%, largely due to the beginning of the year and midyear price increases Martin Marietta made during 2023. Higher interest rates continue to weigh on aggregate end markets despite strength in some end markets like manufacturing and energy. These markets have propped up aggregate shipments and will likely continue for much of the year. That said, there have been few signs of reprieve for housing starts and light commercial construction as higher interest rates constrain demand, a trend we expect will persist for much of the year. Infrastructure spending continues to contribute to aggregate shipments, but we maintain that it will be a slow trickle rather than an immediate spending spree. We expect spending to continue ramping into 2024, with infrastructure likely buoying Martin Mariettas aggregate shipments during the year.","Not-in-my-backyard tendencies make the permitting process very difficult for new quarries, forming high barriers to entry and protecting Martin Mariettas aggregates business from incoming entrants. Martin Marietta's geographic footprint is heavy in states that have strong need and the financial capability for an increase in road work. Martin Mariettas exposure toward publicly funded infrastructure and repair activity has proved to be resilient during an economic downcycle.","Political partisanship and the desire to reduce government spending threaten the stability for publicly funding infrastructure projects. Martin Marietta has higher exposure to downstream materials than some competitors. These no-moat businesses do not benefit from high barriers to entry and yield lower returns.  Martin Mariettas earnings depend on volatile outside factors such as U.S. economic performance, government budgets, and weather.",14/02/2024,"Martin Marietta is well positioned to benefit from increased U.S. infrastructure spending. Although mainly an aggregates producer, the company also has cement production in Texas. We forecast strengthening demand growth for the public sector and modest growth for the private sector. Accounting for roughly half of shipments, public-sector demand is generally more stable, and projects, primarily highway construction, are more aggregate-intensive per dollar of spending. However, in recent years, this sector's demand has been low relative to historical levels amid underfunding that has led to worsening conditions. Federal funding power has weakened over time, as better vehicle mileage and inflation have diminished the buying power of the $0.18 per gallon gasoline tax, unchanged since 1993. The FAST Act, passed in December 2015, provided stability and near-term funding certainty, but did not solve the still-weakening gas tax. However, long-term federal funding was passed in late 2021, totaling $1.2 trillion.  The outlook for road spending differs considerably from state to state. Differences in population growth, road conditions, funding mechanisms, and overall state fiscal health influence spending. Martin Marietta's footprintheavy in Texas, Colorado, Georgia, North Carolina, and Minnesotahas significant road spending needs and strong finances to support robust growth.  Private-sector demand consists of residential and nonresidential construction, including commercial and industrial properties. Nonresidential construction is the most important driver in the category, as spending is more material-intensive per dollar than residential construction. We forecast nonresidential spending growth to moderate in the longer term, as we expect many key sectors to make more efficient use of their construction spending. Additionally, we expect residential starts to converge to our long-term housing-start forecast of 1.365 million by 2032. Residential construction historically supports nonresidential construction growth.","We think Martin Marietta benefits from durable competitive advantages that should support economic profits for at least the next 10 years. We assign Martin Marietta a narrow moat rating based on its intangible assets and cost advantage. Martin Marietta is one of the largest producers of aggregates in the United States. The company also produces ready-mixed concrete, cement, asphalt, and magnesia-based products. The U.S. aggregates market is highly fragmented and comprises over 1,000 companies. Many of these firms operate small, local operations that pale in comparison to Martin Marietta. The low value/weight ratio of aggregates severely limits the range of deliveries and places an importance on quarry locations while permits are very difficult to obtain. Martin Marietta also benefits from a regional transportation cost advantage over distant competitors. This advantage stems from the companys permits, which prevent significant increases in supply in Martin Mariettas existing regions. The commoditized nature of building materials requires companies to possess cost advantages in order to reliably generate economic profits.Aggregates account for over half of Martin Mariettas consolidated revenue and an even larger portion of the companies gross profits. Aggregates typically sell for roughly $20 or more per ton, leading to an extremely low value/weight ratio. Given the lack of water or rail access at most quarries, more than three fourths of aggregates ship by truck. Transportation by truck costs roughly $0.15-$0.65 per ton per mile, limiting the potential range of deliveries to roughly 50 miles or less before transportation costs begin to outweigh the cost of the aggregate itself. Martin Mariettas quarries tend to be located close to its customers in highly populated urban areas. Distant outside operators would need to subsidize their prices (lowering profitability) to encourage customers to incur higher transportation costs. With most aggregates producers lacking efficient water or rail alternatives, markets tend to be extremely localized, with high barriers to entry. The highly fragmented nature of the industry, which consists of many local markets and low market shares, is testament to the difficulty of transporting the product long distances.Martin Marietta benefits from permits (intangible assets) that are difficult to obtain and make it challenging for competitors to open new quarries. Building material producers face extreme opposition from local communities in obtaining approval for quarries due to the environmental impact and noise pollution that production causes. Not-in-my-backyard tendencies make the permitting process difficult in developed markets and create a high barrier to entry. Once a quarry is present in a region, the likelihood of authorities permitting additional capacity is highly unlikely. Furthermore, while populous metropolitan areas are the centers of construction activity, new quarry permits are difficult to obtain as a result of not-in-my-backyard tendencies. We think Martin Mariettas competitive advantage is durable because we do not anticipate the importance of aggregates in construction diminishing, transportation costs to fall, or new quarry permits to become easier to obtain.Infrastructure projects are typically resilient during economic downturns as governments tend to fund projects through the cycle to support the economy and prevent job losses. Stable demand has supported consistent price increases through economic cycles and led to subsequent margin expansion for manufacturers. From 2004 to 2021, Martin Mariettas price increases exceeded inflation in all but five years. During this period, the companys price per ton rose more than 90%, while inflation rose roughly 43%. Additionally, Martin Marietta only recorded one year of price contraction during this 18-year period. This is a testament to the firms durable pricing power, even during times of softer demand. During the most recent construction demand trough, the company failed to generate returns on invested capital in excess of its cost of capital as historical levels of construction led to a record slowdown in spending. Utilization rates took years in some areas to catch up with completed projects, which slowed recovery and weighed on Martin Mariettas returns for multiple years. During the most recent construction demand trough (the period prior to the COVID-19 downturn), the company failed to generate returns on invested capital in excess of its cost of capital. We think high capacity utilization will be necessary to generate excess returns. Because we do not have the confidence that demand will be strong enough to reach appropriate levels of utilization throughout the entire construction cycle, we refrain from assigning the company a wide moat rating at this time.Martin Mariettas cement business benefits from similar competitive advantages as its aggregates business and accounts for roughly 10% of the firms 2023 revenue. While cement typically sells for over $170 per ton (compared with $20 per ton for aggregates), the potential range of deliveries is limited to around 250 miles or less before transportation becomes unprofitable. Unlike aggregates, where numerous quarries are spread across the U.S, there are roughly 100 cement plants in the U.S compared with well over 1,000 aggregates quarries. While cement can be transported slightly farther than aggregates due to its higher price per ton, the industry still benefits from a similar transportation cost advantage. Regulatory permits are also difficult to obtain for cement plants and they tend to come with operating and production limits. Like aggregate quarries, not-in-my-backyard tendencies exist with cement plants and make it difficult to open a new plant. We think downstream materials such as ready-mixed concrete and asphalt (byproducts of cement and aggregates) do not benefit from an economic moat. The low value-to-weight argument (cost advantage) does not hold since producers do not require permits (intangible assets) that prevent new entrants. For asphalt, 95% of the weight is composed of aggregates while aggregates make up roughly 80% of ready-mixed concrete. Essentially, aggregates are mixed with water and cement or liquid asphalt cement to produce ready-mixed concrete and asphalt. There are almost no barriers to entry for the mixing process, as anyone can purchase the inputs to produce concrete or asphalt. This creates a highly competitive market where participants compete on price. These products are also relatively commoditized, which results in these businesses generating lower profit margins than producers of upstream materials, which exhibit greater barriers to entry. Martin Marietta produces cement internally, but a majority of its supply is sourced from third parties. While Martin Mariettas building materials business is moatworthy, we don't think its magnesia specialties business operates with a durable competitive advantage. The segment sells magnesia-based chemical products and dolomitic lime to a variety of industries. We dont think this business enjoys the barriers to entry that protect the companys aggregates business, as the location the of facilities is not as important and the ability to open new kilns is not as difficult. Nevertheless, as the segment accounts for roughly 5% of the companys total sales, we do not think the business lack of competitive advantage is enough to negate the moat established by Martin Mariettas building materials business. ","We assign Martin Marietta a Medium Uncertainty Rating. The biggest risk for Martin Marietta is weak construction, but risks differ among end markets. Compared with the private sector, public-sector construction is generally more stable because of its reliance on government funding. The most significant risk for public-sector construction is state and federal funding. The Federal Highway Trust Fund is an important source of highway construction dollars, primarily funded from gas and diesel taxes. These have been unchanged since 1993, with no inflation or fuel efficiency adjustment. The risk was muted by the passing of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act in late 2021. This is a $1.2 trillion infrastructure bill, with approximately $110 billion going to roads, bridges, and major projects. While we expect some near-term volatility in private sector spending, specifically in residential construction, the 2021 infrastructure bill should provide strong public-sector demand. Martin Marietta is exposed to a few environmental, social, and governance risks, including environmental and social impact of emissions from the firm's operations and the use of its products by customers. However, we don't believe these risks could result in material value destruction. We think there is a high probability of increased regulations surrounding carbon emissions that will likely raise Martin Mariettas operations costs. Stricter energy efficiency requirements could also lead to higher energy prices, which already make up a large portion of Martin Mariettas production costs. Martin Marietta also faces increased regulation over its cement business. Cement production is highly regulated as it releases carbon dioxide during production. However, given no alternatives to aggregates and cement in the construction process, we see a low materiality impact to Martin Marietta's valuation, as any increased costs should ultimately be passed on to end-market customers.","We assign Martin Marietta an Exemplary Capital Allocation Rating, which reflects our forward-looking assessments of the firm's financial health, investment strategy and efficacy (both organic and inorganic), and shareholder distribution policy. Our Exemplary rating is a function of our sound balance sheet, exceptional investments, and appropriate shareholder distribution ratings.We view Martin Marietta's balance sheet as sound. Although the company operates in an industry with medium unleveraged business risk underpinned by the high revenue cyclicality from its construction end-markets, it carries low balance sheet risk. Very low leverage and very low near-term debt maturities support its healthy balance sheet. Although the company has used leverage to fund large M&A deals historically, it has a proven record of restoring balance sheet health in the subsequent years. As such, we don't think acquisitions play a major risk in its future balance sheet health.We see Martin Marietta's investments as exceptional. As one of the largest player in the U.S aggregates market, the company continues to successfully expand its footprint and has grown both organically and inorganically. Martin Marietta has selected its end markets well, with its largest states having favorable demographics. This includes robust demand for road work, financial capacity to pay for projects, and above-average population growth. In more recent years, the company has completed appropriate acquisitions. The 2021 acquisition of Tiller and Lehigh Hanson's U.S. west region assets expanded the firms aggregates, cement, and asphalt footprint. Martin Marietta has also done an excellent job integrating acquisitions. Thus, our view on Martin Mariettas investment decisions is unchanged even after that deal. Finally, we think distributions are appropriate. Since 2015, Martin Marietta has steadily increased its dividend without sacrificing its balance sheet health or its investments while periodically executed share repurchases. We expect continued dividend growth and additional share repurchases as Martin Marietta continues to generate solid free cash flows.","Martin Marietta Materials is one of the United States' largest producer of construction aggregates (crushed stone, sand, and gravel). In 2023, Martin Marietta sold 199 million tons of aggregates. Martin Marietta's most important markets include Texas, Colorado, North Carolina, Georgia, and Florida, accounting for most of its sales. The company also produces cement in Texas and uses its aggregates in its asphalt and ready-mixed concrete businesses. Martins magnesia specialties business produces magnesia-based chemical products and dolomitic lime.","We think Martin Marietta has a sound capital structure, and its consistent free cash flow generation should easily support its debt-service requirements and future capital-allocation decisions. The company's leverage increased following its 2021 acquisition of Tiller and Lehigh Hanson's U.S. west region assets. At the end of 2023, net leverage was roughly 1.5 times net debt/adjusted EBITDA, compared with managements target of roughly 2-2.5 times as it continued to pay down debt. Continued improvement in construction markets should help leverage to improve further, and we expect net debt/adjusted EBITDA to stay within managements target. The company has roughly $4 billion in outstanding debt with staggered maturities through 2051; its next maturity is in 2024 when roughly $400 million is due. Following Martin Mariettas significant acquisitions, we expect future acquisitions will be smaller in size and focus on companies that can expand the firms aggregates business. Martin Marietta has a history of strong free cash flow generation, even in a downturn, which demonstrates the durability of its business model."
19,22/02/2024,Schroders Has a Good Strategy to Deal With Margin Pressure,Schroders PLC,SDR,4,,Johann Scholtz,403.5,GBX,21/02/2024,470.0,Medium,Narrow,Standard,,,,"The asset-management business model remains highly cash-generative with a limited need for fixed or working capital investment combined with wide operating margins driving profitability. Schroders continues to attract net new inflows ahead of the industry average, driven by investment performance, advisory relationships, and having the right products available. Low interest rates should continue to support asset valutions.",The active asset-management industry is in secular decline. Schroders has not been an exception. Fee margins have declined by one third over the past decade and the declining trend is showing no signs of slowing down as competition from passive investment and regulatory pressure continue to eat into margins. Schroders is caught in an uncomfortable middle ground. It neither has the scale to compete against the global giants nor is it a nimble boutique focused on a niche. Global markets are overbought and a material correction is around the corner.,27/11/2023,"Margin pressure sums up the challenge and investment case for Schroders. Like most of its U.K. peers, Schroders has seen a material decline in its management fee margin. To halt this decline, Schroders has laid out a strategy that hits all the right notes. It will focus its resources on higher-margin asset classes, increasing ownership of client relationships, and investing heavily in technology to compete in a digital world. Schroders is executing well on this strategy and early signs are that the decline in margins is at least slowing down. Schroders has made some judicious acquisitions that support its strategy Actively managed long-only equity and fixed-income funds have increasingly struggled to justify their higher prices compared with passive products. Asset managers reacted by increasingly focusing resources on less-commoditized products like private assets, hedge funds, and asset allocation funds.  Schroders wants to move closer to the client and own the client relationship. It is expanding into distribution at the top end of the retail investor market through its Cazenove Capital brand, while the recently launched joint venture with Lloyds bank, Schroders Personal Wealth, into the middle market is its chosen vehicle. While advice offered to clients needs to be impartial, opportunities still exist through the use of model portfolios, for example, to utilize Schroders investment capabilities and fund range. Client longevity for wealth management clients is much longer than for clients through third-party broker channels. Schroders is increasingly looking to achieve the desired client outcomes rather than focusing purely on performance. Liability-driven investments for institutional clients or absolute return-type products for retail investors are examples of this. Schroders has an explicit strategy to increase its switching costs by expanding its presence in categories it views as stickier or having greater client longevity, as Schroders phrases itevidence of the improved persistency of Schroders' clients and the success of this strategy. The average longevity of Schroders clients has increased to 5.3 years in 2021 compared with 4.1 years in 2016. ","We believe that Schroders has a narrow moat rating from switching costs and intangible assets, which support a midcycle return on invested capital of 14% comfortably ahead of our cost of capital estimate.Typically, we find economic moats in switching costs and intangible assets for asset managers. Schroders has an explicit strategy to increase its switching costs by expanding its presence in categories it views as stickier or having greater client longevity, as Schroders phrases it. The continued improvement in the redemption rate (gross annual redemptions of funds over assets under management) from 34% in 2010 to 18% in 2021 provides strong objective evidence of the improved persistency of Schroders' clients and the success of this strategy. Over the past 10 years Schroders has on average seen a net annual inflow equal to 4% of its AUM. Only in 2018 did it see a net outflow of 2%. Over the same time frame Europe asset managers saw net inflows of on average 2% of AUM per year. The average longevity of Schroders clients has increased to 5.3 years in 2021 compared with 4.1 years in 2016.Schroders believes that wealth management, alternative assets (real estate, private equity, credit, impact investment, and so on) and asset allocation funds are categories with lower redemption rates and greater client longevity. It is no coincidence that these asset classes are also typically the least commoditized and are least at risk from passive strategies. Wealth management still relies on a high level of client interaction, especially for truly wealthy individuals and family offices with the need for bespoke services. Alternative assets typically do not lend themselves to index replication as the markets tend to be illiquid with limited price discovery, and there are limited, if any, reliable indexes available. Put simply, generic asset allocation strategies can be replicated passively to a degree, but bespoke strategies with certain investment goals in mind, for instance, liability-driven investment for pension funds need the active involvement of investment professionals. Schroders has a full suite of products, which could support switching costs as it can capture clients looking to move from one investment strategy to another internally. We believe that Schroders' performance track record, brand, and established relations with intermediaries support an intangible assets economic moat. There are several ways firms can build intangible assets in asset management. We believe there are certain structural attributes (such as product mix, distribution channel concentration, and geographic reach) and intangible assets (such as strong brands and entrenched sales relationships) that can enhance an asset manager's ability to not only attract new assets, but also retain them for longer periods once they have been collected. Strong historical performance tends to be critical to building a good brand. Above-average near- to medium-term performance tends to be a big driver of fund flows. Firms with long records of solid performance build up a reputation that can see them through good times and bad. Schroders' funds have a good track record of outperformance. As of Dec. 31, 2021, 79% of Schroders' assets under management outperformed its benchmark over 3 years and 78% of assets outperformed its benchmark over the past 5 years. Asset management is a talent business, which is why People is one of the three pillars used by Morningstar Manager Research's three-pillar framework methodology to evaluate fundstogether with Process and Parent. Morningstar Manager Research believes that Schroders, as the parent, has a positive influence on the funds in its stable and notes that Schroders' standout expertise is in equities, where the fund manager lineup is generally of a high caliber, boasts longevity at the firm, and is backed by sensible succession planning.While strict regulation in the U.K. ensures that relationships with advisors in the retail market and trustees/consultants in the institutional market are at an arm's-length basis, we do believe that Schroders has built up strong relationships with these intermediaries and that its longevity and performance track record build trust.","We assign Schroders a Medium Morningstar Uncertainty Rating. By its nature fund management is a cyclical business. Management fees are directly correlated to the level of markets, while performance fees further increase cyclicality as managers tend to earn far greater performance fees during bull markets. Client investment flows also tend to dry up during bear markets, which exacerbates cyclicality even more. Asset managers also tend to have reasonably high levels of operating leverage as fixed costs dominate their cost bases. We believe that Schroders has a greater portion of variable compensation than its continental European peers, which reduces its operating leverage. Schroders' balance sheet is directly exposed to market risk. To start up a new fund often requires Schroders to stump up an initial investment or seed money. On the balance sheet this is money that is exposed to the vagaries of the market, sometimes in new and unproven strategies, exposing Schroders to market risk. Schroders invests 15% of its capital as seed money or as co-investments.Liquid alternative strategies introduce some liquidity risk onto Schroders' balance sheet. So-called liquid alternative strategies have been a growth area for Schroders and many other asset managers. Using these strategies the asset manager provides retail investors the opportunity to benefit from the returns and diversification of alternative potentially illiquid assets, including hedge funds, private assets, and real assets. The investments are packaged within a conventional mutual fund, with investors benefiting from the normal liquidity associated with mutual funds. The fund manager carries the risk of any liquidity mismatch. Schroders' liquid alternative strategies are mainly hedge fund-based and are therefore more liquid than ""liquid alt"" funds invested in highly illiquid private equity and unlisted credits.","We assign Schroders a Standard Morningstar Capital Allocation Rating. Schroders has been actively making mostly smallish bolt-on acquisitions, expanding its business mostly on the distribution (wealth management) side and some acquisitions to expand its product capability. Most of the acquisitions have been fairly recent and it is hard to tell if they have been value-accretive yet. Some investors may argue that Schroders has the capacity to gear up its balance sheet and look to execute share buybacks. We are happy that Schroders has remained conservative; leveraged and cyclical businesses with high operating leverage tend to be problematic. It also leaves Schroders with firepower to make a large acquisition, although we do prefer its current incremental approach.","Schroders is an independent, U.K.-based, active asset manager founded in 1804. The bulk of Schroders' client assets are from institutions, but its retail operations are more profitable. Schroders has also increasingly expanded its wealth management presence. The U.K. accounts for just under half of Schroders' assets under management, while continental Europe and Asia account for 20% each. In 2013 Schroders purchased the Cazenove private clients business from JP Morgan, expanding its wealth management business. It recently formed a joint venture with Lloyds Bank, Schroders Personal Wealth, to provide independent financial advice to midmarket clients. Wealth management makes up around 15% of earnings and revenue.","We believe Schroders is financially very sound. Schroders does not have any long-term debt on its balance sheet and it has limited fixed- or working capital needs. While it does offer insurance products and takes deposits as part of its wealth management activities, the capital requirements of these businesses are a small portion of Schroders' consolidated capital requirements."
20,22/02/2024,Link REIT to Achieve Long-Term Growth Through Capital Recycling,Link Real Estate Investment Trust,00823,5,09/02/2024,Xinfu Lee,38.25,HKD,21/02/2024,59.0,Low,None,Exemplary,,09/02/2024,"No-moat Link REIT announced the acquisition of the remaining 50% interest in Qibao Vanke Plaza in Shanghai. The estimated consideration of CNY 2.4 billion is based on an agreed property value of CNY 5.2 billion, which represents a 26.3% discount to the appraised property value of CNY 7.1 billion as of end-January 2024. With a monthly passing income of CNY 40.6 million from the mall and the car park, we estimate an attractive net property income yield of around 7%. After updating our model for this acquisition, we raise our fiscal 2025 and 2026 (ending March) distribution per unit forecast slightly to HKD 2.63 and HKD 2.86, respectively, implying a fiscal 2025 distribution yield of 6.9%. We maintain our fair value estimate of HKD 59 as we previously assumed that the rights issue proceeds would be redeployed for acquisitions. Although the acquisition represents only around 1% of the current investment properties portfolio value, we like that the deal is accretive and should help alleviate investors earlier concern on the lack of acquisition after the rights issue in February 2023. The consideration paid represents only 14% of the rights issue proceeds, and the low pro forma net gearing of 20.4% implies there remains headroom for further investments. We believe more accretive acquisitions are needed to restore investors confidence on Link REITs capital management. That said, we think units are currently undervalued with a 35% discount to our fair value estimate.","Capital recycling is expected to enable Link REIT to consolidate around its top assets and dominate key districts. The portfolio effect enables the company to initiate another round of AEIs and reposition its assets, in our view. We believe enhanced infrastructure connecting Hong Kong and the Pearl River Delta benefits the companys assets in outlying districts, potentially expanding their catchment. Acquisitions in China represent another potent growth driver. Link REIT is one of the few mass-retail-focused companies with the necessary capital and experience.","The company exhausted its primary growth driver of higher rents and lower vacancies for its Hong Kong portfolio and is seeking riskier expansion internationally. The company is unable to utilize proceeds from rights issue on accretive acquisitions. China is a different competitive and regulatory environment, and the company is unlikely to achieve the same type of rental growth there as in its Hong Kong portfolio.",09/11/2023,"Link REIT is one of the worlds largest retail-focused REITs. Its portfolio contains 154 properties across Hong Kong, mainland China, Australia, Singapore, and the United Kingdom. The Hong Kong retail properties make up over 50% of portfolio value. Its retail space in Hong Kong can be categorized into three subsegments. Destination or flagship properties are malls with an enhanced trade mix and unique branding, while community malls are midsize, serving as local community hubs. Smaller properties are at a neighborhood level, providing essential goods and services for daily living. With the majority of its overall portfolio in community and neighborhood malls, Link is a dominant player in the more resilient district center-type assets. Since its IPO, the company has demonstrated strong earnings and distribution growth. By applying asset-enhancement initiatives, or AEIs, and industry-best practices in property management, Link has achieved higher rental and declining vacancies. The following phase of growth has been driven by asset consolidation and district dominance. After disposing of lower-tier assets, Link uses the proceeds to acquire commercially developed properties. Link typically looks for properties in districts where its top-tier assets already hold leading positions. With the acquisitions, it seeks to establish a dominant portfolio of retail assets in the area. Link then gradually repositions the assets' focus from mass-market to midmarket discretionary, expanding catchment to residents of private housing estates nearby. This opens the assets to a new category of retailers, allowing continuously rising rent levels and enabling new AEIs. Through capital recycling, the company has expanded into new areas. In Hong Kong, it converted a former government office building into a retail complex and developed an office project in Kowloon East. Acquisitions continued apace in retail, office, and logistics assets in mainland China, Singapore, Australia, and the U.K. The company is looking to further expand through capital partnerships, targeting Tier 1 cities in China and select Asian markets.","We assign Link REIT a no-moat rating. Link acquired its earliest assets from the Hong Kong Housing Authority in 2005, which were developed a few decades ago to serve nearby public housing estates in Hong Kong. Link later widened its investment mandate to allow for property development and acquisition outside of Hong Kong. It has since expanded its footprint to office, retail and logistics assets in mainland China, Sydney and Melbourne in Australia, London in the U.K, as well as Singapore. The company continues to look for opportunities in first-tier cities in mainland China and select overseas markets, after its rights issue in early 2023. While we think it is possible for the Hong Kong retail portfolio to benefit from efficient scale, we think future investments outside of Hong Kong are less likely to ensure an excessive return over cost of capital as land is generally less constrained. Adding on to that, the current high interest rate environment may lead to an expansion in capitalization rates, putting downward pressure on property valuations. As a result, Link REIT may not be able to reproduce valuation gains that had historically allowed it to achieve high returns above its cost of capital. As of September 2023, Link REIT has 98 retail properties in Hong Kong, with an area of over 8 million square feet. They are generally located in heavily trafficked and built-up areas with large residential catchments, including both public and private housing estates, serving the daily needs of the population in the neighborhood. As such, Link REITs malls are dominated by tenants in the nondiscretionary trade. Link REITs assets frequently represent the only or the majority of the shopping facilities in the vicinity. We think the demand for retail space in the relevant areas is closely tied with the population in the nearby estates. We believe demand in areas where Link REIT has a presence is largely mature, and we do not anticipate a material increase in demand due to a lack of suitable sites for new housing supply.We do not expect new entrants to develop new retail assets in areas where Link has a strong presence, due to the high cost of land given the land scarcity in Hong Kong, and that the areas are already highly built up. Stock of retail assets in Hong Kong increased by only 3.7% in the past five years, according to data from the Rating and Valuation Department. The increase was primarily driven by key development areas, such as Kwun Tong Town Centre and Tseung Kwan O, where Link REIT does not have a significant presence. That said, with most of Links Hong Kong retail assets having undergone some degree of upgrade or asset enhancement, we are concerned that it may not be able to increase valuations in the future as it did historically. This is compounded by the current high interest rate environment pressuring asset valuations.Link has expanded its footprint to other asset classes in mainland China, Australia, the U.K., and Singapore. The first step after the expansion of Links investment mandate was the acquisition of land in Kowloon East for an office property development project via a joint venture with Nan Fung Development. Later in 2016, Link acquired 700 Nathan Road through government tender, which has a 25-story office tower above the retail portion. We do not think Links Hong Kong office portfolio can benefit from efficient scale. Grade A office supply in Kwun Tong, where Link REITs key office asset is located, has increased significantly, with an 8.3% CAGR in the past two decades. We think the new supply was spurred by the redevelopment of industrial properties to retail and office properties, given the governments ambition to develop the area as a second central business district, or CBD. The area will continue to see about a 4% increase in Grade A office supply in the coming two years, despite a vacancy of 19.5% as of end-2022, well above 12.1% for overall Hong Kong Grade A offices, according to data from JLL. We do not think that Link REITs key office asset will be able to outcompete its peers amid the oversupply, given the distance to the subway station.Similarly for the Shanghai office property, we do not think it can benefit from efficient scale. Although the Shanghai office property, Link Square, is located favorably in the Huangpu District in Shanghai and is well-serviced by metro lines, the office stock in existing CBDs is less constrained, and new CBDs are being created. According to Cushman & Wakefield data, there is 1.5 million square meters, or 18% of existing stock, of Grade A office planned and under construction in the Shanghai CBDs. Link also owns a number of retail assets in Tier 1 cities in China. Yet, retail area supply in these cities is less constrained than that in Hong Kong, with over 20% increase in supply in the respective submarkets in the coming years, according to Cushman & Wakefield data. In addition, Link REITs mainland retail portfolio typically represents 1-2 small to medium-size malls in each city it operates in, and represents only a small portion of the respective submarkets.Link has also entered into the industrial space in China. The trust holds five logistics assets in the Greater Bay Area, or GBA, and Yangtze River Delta, or YRD, accounting for 1.1% of total portfolio value. These assets are externally managed, as Link REIT gradually accumulates experience in the asset class. These properties are typically located in city fringes where land supply is less constrained. According to Savills, Changshu, where two of Links assets are located, doubled its stock in 2022; while Dongguan and Foshan, where Links GBA assets are located, both showed double-digit increases in stock. We continue to expect new supply of premium logistics space and hence, we do not ascribe a moat to the logistics segment.For its overseas portfolio, we think Jurong Point in Singapore can benefit from an efficient scale moat source. Jurong Point is the largest suburban mall in Singapore. It is also the only mall in the vicinity, amid a highly built-up residential area. The mall enjoys great connectivity, with access to a subway station and bus interchange. This, together with a population catchment of around 360,000 persons, or 6% of Singapores total population, enables excellent shopper footfall within the asset. We think the mall will continue to enjoy high occupancy and healthy rental growth in the future. However, we think the overall segment has no moat as Jurong Point only makes up about 40% of Link REITs overseas portfolio, while we believe the rest of its overseas assets do not dominate their respective submarkets.We see prudent management of environmental, social, and governance issues in Link REIT and believe the trusts ESG risk exposure is an immaterial effect on our Uncertainty Rating. REITs in general face environmental issues associated with green buildings as well as energy and water consumption in managing their properties. Link has set clear policies on responsible property investment, or RPI, which takes into account the sustainable qualifications of buildings in the due diligence of investment process. The trust has also extended RPI to operations and maintenance, aiming to reduce energy and water consumption through the use of renewable energy, recycled water, and water-efficient fittings and fixtures. We believe this is positive as the reduced energy consumption has a direct impact on the trusts operating expense.For Link REIT, the impact of district and neighborhood malls on the daily lives of the local communities means there is a greater importance on ""social"" aspects within ESG issues, relative to peers, in our view. One example is the asset-enhancement initiatives, which improve the quality of the mall but at the same time, results in a rental increase for its tenants. The latter may be passed on to consumers and is particularly sensitive for its assets located closer to public housing estates. In finding the right balance, Link has set out policies and procedures on tenant engagement, as well as providing assistance to the underprivileged, among other measures taken. Links effort in ESG integration was recognized by inclusion in the Dow Jones Sustainability Asia Pacific Index, FTSE4Good Index Series, and the Hang Seng Corporate Sustainability Index. Links ESG efforts also have a direct impact on profitability as it enables interest cost savings in all its sustainability-linked bonds, provided they achieve sustainability milestones based on their performance in the Global Real Estate Sustainability Benchmark.","We assign Link REIT a Low Morningstar Uncertainty Rating. With over 70% of its portfolio by value located in Hong Kong, the company faces the key risk of a significant deterioration in economic activities in the city. However, given the focus on mass- and mid-market non-discretionary and a tenant mix skewed toward defensive trades, such as food and beverage and supermarket, the company is less exposed to the cyclicality of consumer spending and the risk of online shopping. That said, new growth initiatives of capital recycling and overseas acquisitions may involve a higher degree of execution risk.We believe Link REITs ESG risks are low and immaterial to the company. We therefore do not expect material value destruction from ESG issues to undermine the economic moat.","We assign Link REIT an Exemplary Capital Allocation Rating. The REIT has sound balance sheet management, which we think can support its debt obligations even through times of distress. Links gearing ratio of less than 30% is below the regulatory threshold of 50%, suggesting a manageable leverage level, and implying that there remains debt headroom available. The majority of Link REITs assets focus on nondiscretionary trade malls, so we do not expect any material decline in profitability during economic downturns. With its staggered debt maturity profile, we do not expect Link to experience any difficulty in handling its debt obligations, given its stable cash flows and record of successfully refinancing its debt.We view Links investments as exceptional, given its active asset-enhancement initiatives and capital recycling programs. Historically, Link has invested in asset-enhancement projects to upgrade its properties. In the first decade since its listing, Link has increased its book value per share by a compound annual growth rate of 19%, partly attributable to net property income growth. By improving the attractiveness of its assets, Link has achieved a five-year average historical return on AEI of over 15%. On the acquisition side, the REIT has historically performed capital recycling by divesting some of its smaller and lower-yielding assets to consolidate its position in dominance in certain growing districts, which we believe would fortify its narrow moat in efficient scale. From 2016, the REIT has expanded its mandate to include assets in mainland China, Sydney, Melbourne, London, and Singapore in its portfolio. We believe these higher-yielding assets could bring diversification benefits as well as improved profitability to Link, thus adding value to shareholders. Links target is to increase its mainland and overseas assets to around 30%-40% of its total portfolio. With a strong cash position and a slightly undergeared balance sheet, we expect more investment opportunities for Link.With the growth opportunities mainly financed by capital recycling, Link has historically maintained a 100% payout ratio, well above the mandated 90%. The REIT has also been active in various capital-return programs, including share-buyback programs, as well as additional discretionary distributions in fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2021.","Link REIT is Asia's largest REIT, listed in 2005 to privatize retail assets held by the Hong Kong Housing Authority. It owns 154 properties and about 60,000 car park spaces. It expanded its investment mandate in 2014 to allow overseas acquisitions and has since acquired retail and office properties in China, as well as an office development project in Hong Kong. More recently, Link expanded its footprint to Sydney, Melbourne, London, and Singapore.","Link REIT is conservatively managed. In the decade since listing, the companys gearing, defined as the debt/total assets ratio, has fallen to 13% from 28%, benefiting from strong revaluation gains and strong net property income growth. Acquisition activities in China and office development in Hong Kong pushed gearing back up to around 16% in fiscal 2016 and 2017. A large disposal in late 2017 brought gearing back down to the single digits and provided room for additional mainland and overseas acquisitions. As of September 2023, gearing remains low at 18.0%. With a strong balance sheet and recurring income, the company has good access to funding. Its effective interest cost averaged around 2.5% over the past three years. It has taken advantage of the low interest-rate environment by extending the average maturity of the debt profile to 3.4 years, with fixed-rate debt accounting for around 70% of total debt outstanding. Average borrowing cost has increased to 3.74% in the first half of fiscal 2024 amid the high interest-rate environment. We expect interest cost to remain at a higher level for the next two years, before edging down thereafter."
21,22/02/2024,Judo Capital Loan Growth Rates to Slow as Higher-Margin Business Is Prioritized,Judo Capital Holdings Ltd,JDO,3,23/01/2024,Nathan Zaia,1.21,AUD,22/02/2024,1.2,High,None,Standard,,23/01/2024,"Judo Capital provided a much better-than-expected first-half 2024 trading update and provided fiscal 2024 pretax profit guidance around 40% higher than our prior forecast. Net interest margins, or NIM, were down less than expected, operating expense growth was effectively restrained, and bad debt expenses were still very low. However, target loan book of up to AUD 10.7 billion by June 2024, up 20% on last year, is lower than the AUD 11.3 billion we had forecast. Management appears to be leaning towardpreserving margins and profits in the short term even if it means slowing loan growth. We have increased our fiscal 2024 pretax forecast by 43% to the top end of guidance at AUD 113 million. The AUD 34 million increase is roughly split 65% to lower operating expenses and the remainder to lower bad debt expenses. The impact on revenue from the higher-than-expected NIM is offset by lower lending growth. First-half expenses increased just 5% on the second half last fiscal year, tracking materially below managements previous guidance that fiscal 2024 expense growth would be around 22%. Our forecasts assume annual expense growth of 9% per year to fiscal 2028. To support our 16% per year loan growth forecast to fiscal 2028, we still expect ongoing investment in bankers and technology, and the cost of attracting and retaining staff is also likely to rise as banking industry profitability recovers. Our fiscal 2025 profit forecast increases 6%, on modestly higher NIM and lower operating expenses, while profit forecasts are not materially changed. Our fair value estimate increases by 9% to AUD 1.20 per share after incorporating stronger earnings. Shares jumped over 15% on the day of the positive trading update, but remain at a modest discount to our revised fair value estimate. NIM of 3.02% in the half fell from 3.34% in the prior half. Repayment of the term funding facility is materially increasing funding costs for Judo.","Judos strong customer focus attracts small and midsize business customers, enabling the bank to grow its loan book quickly and realize operating leverage benefits.  Starting from scratch and free of a parent company, Judo is unencumbered with legacy systems and processes which can interfere with prioritizing employee and customer satisfaction. Margins expand as reduced competition for customer deposits results in the cost of Judos largest funding source, term deposits, fall. ","Judos point of differentiation is eroded by major banks adding more bankers to complement investments in digital offerings, and use of data from payments and transaction accounts to make approval decisions.  A tougher regulatory capital burden relative to the majors makes it harder to compete on price and achieve a return on equity acceptable to shareholders. Economic conditions weaken materially and Judos loan book experiences much higher loss rates than peers. ",23/01/2024,"Judo Capital, or Judo, began as a nonbank lender in 2016, using seed capital and debt facilities to establish itself as a lender to Australian small and midsize businesses, or SMBs. Judo received a banking deposit license in 2019. Among its competitors are the big four Australian banks which collectively have around 70% market share of total business loans. Judo has less than 1% share of total Australian business loan market, but we estimate closer to 2% of the SMB market.  Judos strategy is to pay top of market rates on term deposits, and charge an above-average return on its lending to generate a net interest margin above 3%. Judo justifies higher rates on its superior customer service offering, including a dedicated banker, fast approvals, and a less rigid approval process. Taking modestly greater risk and hence being compensated with higher rates is likely contributing to Judos growth.  We think Judo can continue to grow, but exponential growth achieved in recent years will be difficult to maintain. Having access to cheap funding from the Reserve Bank of Australia during the pandemic allowed Judo to lend to more customers than it typically would target, at reasonable attractive margins and return on equity. As its funding costs rise by more than peers, Judo will now likely have to be more selective on which loans it funds. In fiscal 2022, Judos lending margin was 4.5% over the bank bill swap rate. By June 2023, it was down to 3.7% over BBSW.  Profitability is also dependent on operating expenses being scaled and credit quality remaining within the industry average. While not tested through a cycle, Judo's credit quality appears in line with the banking industry. Judo does not have legacy IT systems, branches, or a wide suite of products, but we still view it as a high-cost lender to the SMB sector. The banker/customer relationship is time-intensive. The success Judo currently enjoys could quickly cease from efforts to increase the number of consumers or size of the loan book each banker is responsible for. ","Judo Bank does not have an economic moat, as it lacks cost advantages (funding, operational, credit) or boasts any material switching costs for customers in the Australian banking system.The four wide-moat-rated Australian major banks account for almost 70% of the business loan market. As a small market player, Judos market share in its target small to midsize business segment is very small at less than 2%. For comparison, the market leader National Australia Bank has around 27% share of SMB loans. Judos small loan book, and higher funding and operational costs relative to peers, translated to return on equity of about 5% in fiscal 2023, compared with low-double-digit returns for the majors. Judo is at a funding cost disadvantage relative to the Australian major banks. It pays more for both customer deposits and wholesale debt. While a source of funding for larger banks is a large number of customers' at-call accounts which earn low or no interest, Judo is solely reliant on term deposits. With no branches and a limited product offering, plus a desire to grow deposits and loans faster than the market, Judo also pays market-leading rates on term deposits. Judos term deposits are offered directly to retail customers, businesses, and self-managed superannuation funds. Funding costs are also higher than for major banks on wholesale credit, comprising around 20% of Judos midcycle funding. The majors have better credit ratings. Further highlighting the difference in funding costs, in October 2023, Judo announced an additional Tier 1 capital note issuance at a margin of 6.5% over the 1-month bank bill swap rate, while National Australia Bank was able to issue similar notes a few months earlier and only pay a margin of 2.2% over BBSW. To offset the higher funding costs and make a net interest margin above 3%, on average Judo aims to earn 50 basis points more than the peer group in return for dedicated customer service, speed of approvals, and a less rigid approval process. Part of this is likely Judo taking modestly greater risk and hence being compensated with higher rates on customers. While we believe there is a market for such an offering, the fact that Judos average lending rate fell materially in recent years as the loan book grew rapidly suggests it is difficult to maintain rapid growth and maintain such a material premium. In fiscal 2022, Judos lending margin was 4.5% over the BBSW, but by June 2023 it was down to 3.7% over BBSW. The cost/income ratio of 54% is much higher than the cost/income ratio of the major banks in the low to mid-40% range. Despite the major banks supporting a much larger product suite (loans, payments, transaction accounts, personal loans, and credit cards), lower funding costs and operating leverage from a large customer base result in much greater efficiency. Major bank cost/income ratios in business lending average around 35%, with Commonwealth Bank currently the lowest at 30%.Judo does not have legacy IT systems, branches, or a wide suite of products, but we still view it as a high-cost lender to the SMB sector. The banker/customer relationship is time-intensive, with a banker spending 60 hours over a year with a new customer and 30 hours with an existing customer. This is part of Judos differentiation from the majors which have become more reliant on technology and processes to reduce time spent with each customer and enable each banker to have more customers. Judo currently has about 30 customers per banker versus major banks which typically have over 100. The major banks also rely more on centralized customer support teams, which is likely more productive. A model built on customers having a dedicated relationship manager, speedy approvals, and better overall customer experience, will likely prevent the bank from reaching industry-leading cost/income ratios. The success Judo currently enjoys could quickly cease from efforts to increase the number of customers or size of the loan book each banker is responsible for.Two-thirds of Judos customers have previously been with a big bank. Some may have left due to dissatisfaction with customer service, but given the majority come via business brokers, it is likely many are seeking additional or cheaper funding. Depending on the strategy and lending appetite at a point in time, major banks will not always be the cheapest lender to an SMB, so Judo could potentially still win major bank customers and maintain its required lending rate. In other words, we dont think winning a major bank customer will always mean Judo has done so by sacrificing its targeted lending rate. In extending credit to customers that major banks refuse due to more systematic approval processes, there is a risk Judo ends up with a riskier loan book than peers. Judo bankers are mostly generalists, as opposed to many major bank business bankers being specialists in certain sectors, which again has the potential for Judo to underappreciate risk. But we believe Judo can potentially overcome these risks by spending more time to better understand the businesses' cash flows, property used as security, and future growth prospects. Being a new business, untested through different economic cycles, there is limited evidence on how Judo's loan book carrying different credit risk to the industry average will fare. Current arrears levels, adjusting for the young average life of the loan book, are similar to industry average.Small banks also face tougher regulatory capital burdens relative to the majors, making it harder to compete and generate return on equity above cost of capital. The four major banks are qualified to use internal risk models that result in lower-risk weights on various assets (particularly home loans), which require lower capital support. For comparison, credit risk-weighted assets/loans for Judo is currently close to 85%, but for a major bank it is less than 35%.We do not think customer switching costs are very high. The more personalized service that borrowers receive can make customers stickier, but a larger bank with lower funding costs could easily entice customers with lower prices that Judo cannot match. Overall, we think Judo customers are less sticky than those of full-service banks. With no at-call accounts, Judo customers are already using other banks, which means they can easily move to them if motivated by better rates or the convenience of having all banking with one institution. A bank having insight into a business' cash flows (via transaction accounts and payment offerings) can also better target good credit quality borrowers. ","We assign Judo a Morningstar Uncertainty Rating of High. Banks are highly leveraged to economic conditions. Higher interest rates, inflation, and unemployment can materially affect loan growth and bad and doubtful debts. In a severe recession, the bank might not be adequately provisioned. Additionally, Judos main customer base of SMBs are more likely to default than homeowners or large corporates. Being a new business, untested through different economic cycles, there is limited evidence on how Judo's loan book carrying different credit risk to the industry average will fare. Current arrears levels, adjusting for the young average life of the loan book, are similar to the industry average.A failure to continue to grow, or a loss in market share, coupled with a contraction in net interest margins as the bank competes more aggressively on price, could diminish net interest income. Underinvestment in technology, employees, or marketing could result in a poor customer experience and failure to gain or maintain market share. At the same time, the bank must ensure appropriate risk management and lending standards or risk rising on loan losses in the future, especially if the operating environment for SMBs weakens. Small banks such as Judo are also at a cost disadvantage to the major banks. The inability to access wholesale credit markets at the same cost as the majors is a disadvantage. Should offshore funding markets freeze, it would force the majors to compete more aggressively for customer deposits, and Judo would be forced to follow.Judos environmental, social, and governance risks primarily relate to breaches of law and regulatory requirements, unfair treatment of customers, protection of customer data, and lending exposure to environmental and socially sensitive sectors. In our view, the combined probability and materiality of these ESG-related risks is small relative to the cash flows of the bank, and we make no specific allowances in our forecasts.","We assign Judo a Standard Capital Allocation Rating, reflecting our assessment of a sound balance sheet, fair investment efficacy, and appropriate shareholder distributions. The balance sheet is sound. Common equity Tier 1 was 16.2% as of December 2023, well above APRAs 8% minimum capital benchmark for standardized banks. We think loan growth over the next five years will eventually see the ratio fall to mid-11% range over the next five years. The bank took advantage of cheap funding provided by the Reserve Bank of Australia, and in the unlikely event that the bank cannot grow customer deposits as planned, has already put into place warehouse facilities to satisfy its funding requirements. We believe managements investment strategy is fair and will help the bank grow small and midsize business market share. Judo has found an opening in the market for customers underserviced by big banks, or being perceived as too high risk. Reaching profitability in fiscal 2022 has opened up more funding options for the bank. It is appropriate Judo does not pay dividends as it focuses on growth. Operating expenses have increased materially to support a much larger loan book, and the bank needs to extract operating leverage benefits from here to improve return on equity. ","Judo Capital is an Australian bank primarily focused on lending to Australian small and midsize businesses. Judos main lending products are business loans, equipment finance, lines of credit, and home loans. Personal, business, and self-managed superannuation fund term deposits are a key source of funding. ","Judo is well-capitalized with a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 16.2% as of December 2023, well above the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority's 8% minimum capital benchmark for standardized banks. Judo's specific minimum set by the regulator is confidential, but a midcycle common equity Tier 1 ratio of up to 11.5% would be reasonable compared with peers. We do not expect dividends in our forecasts for the next five years, with surplus capital expected to fund growth in the loan book. Judos loan book is about 80% business loans, 10% home loans, 5% asset finance, and 5% lines of credit. About 60% of Judo's loan book is funded by term deposits, 25% by the term funding facility, 10% by warehouse debt, and 5% by a diversified range of Tier 1 and 2 capital including hybrids. As the bank pays back the term funding facility, which is ultra-low rate funding provided by the Reserve Bank of Australia during COVID-19, it is targeting term deposits to make up around 70% to 75% of its funding base, warehouse debt up to 20%, and equity 10%. Judo already has warehouse facilities in place which can cover the TFF. Australian Prudential Regulation Authority announced in November 2023 it will review liquidity and capital requirements for banks such as Judo which are subject to minimum liquidity holdings. Among the potential changes are ensuring assets are valued at current market prices, and not counting investments in other Australian deposit-taking institutions for liquidity purposes. This would likely mean Judo has to replace these securities with lower-yielding government bonds. The major banks will not be affected as they are already subject to more complex liquidity coverage ratio requirements. "
22,22/02/2024,QBE Buoyed by Higher Investment Income as Price Increases Combat Higher Claim Costs,QBE Insurance Group Ltd,QBE,2,16/02/2024,Nathan Zaia,16.71,AUD,22/02/2024,14.0,High,None,Standard,,16/02/2024,"We increase our QBE Insurance fair value estimate by 4% to AUD 14 per share due to the time value of money. Group 2023 pretax profit jumped 2.7 times to USD 1.84 billion, and we dont dwell on a 3% miss against our forecast. The massive turnaround on last year comes courtesy of double-digit premium growth, an improved claims ratio, natural hazard costs within allowances, and investment income on policyholder and shareholder funds doubling. No-moat-rated QBE is guiding to single-digit premium growth in 2024, with the combined ratio (claims plus operating expenses/insurance revenue) improving to 93.5% from 95.2% in 2023. We think the target is achievable, notwithstanding a slowing in premium rate increases due to intensifying competition. While the insurer often intentionally steps away from problem areas, a fall in retention rate to 81% from 84% suggests heightened competition and possibly some policyholders being unable to afford current rates. With shares trading at a 14% premium to our fair value estimate, we think the market overestimates long-term profitability on the back of rising investment income and rate increases. We think 2024 will be another strong year but expect stronger industry profitability to lead to heightened price competition and weaker returns. We expect QBEs return on equity to retrace closer to our 9% cost of equity over the next five years. Group ROE improved to 14% in 2023 from 7.5%. But management did not hit all initial targets, and North American crop profitability remains a sore point. Our midcycle combined ratio assumption of 96% is less optimistic than managements low to mid-90s through-the-cycle target. The latter looks optimistic against a 10-year historical average of 97%. A 10% franked dividend of AUD 0.48 per share takes the full year to AUD 0.62, a dividend payout ratio of 45%. At the same payout ratio, and within managements 40%-60% target range, we assume an AUD 0.80 dividend in 2024.","Rising insurance premiums, underwriting discipline, productivity initiatives, and a focus on profitable growth should drive excess returns. The U.S. operations have significant upside potential. Years of disappointment eventually lead to premium rates reflective of the underlying insured risks. A strong balance sheet and positive premium pricing support dividend growth and the return of surplus capital to shareholders.","Rising competition erodes market share from incumbents, such as QBE, regardless of the impact on short-term profits and returns. A higher incidence of large claims events from major catastrophes could reduce profitability such that dividend cuts and potentially dilutive capital raisings are needed. Insurance becomes unaffordable, resulting in policy downgrading and cancellations. ",16/02/2024,"QBE Insurance is an international property and casualty insurance company with over USD 21 billion of annual gross written premiums. It writes about 25% of its annual premiums in its home region of Australia and New Zealand. Other key markets include North America, Europe, and Asia Pacific. QBE is predominantly focused on specialty insurance lines, but the offering is extremely wide-ranging across property, auto insurance, agriculture, public/product liability, professional indemnity, workers compensation, marine, energy and aviation, and accident and health. The size and diversity of insurance is built on the back of hundreds of acquisitions made over decades.  The extended period of global growth via acquisition failed to deliver the cost synergies or scale benefits management had hoped. The strategy has rightfully shifted, and progress is being made in turning the business around. The balance sheet has been strengthened and operational efficiency is improving. We like the way senior management has reshaped insurance portfolios, cut costs, tightened underwriting standards and increased accountability across the group. In addition to divesting several businesses, a greater focus on returns has led to groupwide improvement in attritional claims. While reducing premiums, decisions to reduce exposure to certain areasfor example, large commercial properties and properties in higher-risk areashas improved profitability and reduced volatility.  The performance of investment markets brings another element of volatility to earnings. QBE manages a sizable investment portfolio of about USD 30 billion as of Dec. 31, 2023, with both policyholder and shareholder funds. Around 90% is held in cash and fixed-interest investments, with the remainder spread across equities and alternatives. Consequently, the group's profitability is at risk from changes in interest rates, credit spreads, and to a lesser extent equity markets. We expect returns to remain suppressed in the short term but gradually recover as global cash rates normalize.","In general, insurers do not benefit from favorable competitive positions because of fierce industry competition and commoditylike products. Customers generally wont pay a sizable premium for brand, and products are replicable, making cost structure the key differentiator. Many insurers do not know their cost of goods sold for years, allowing them to potentially underprice policies without knowing it. Firms have an incentive to chase growth at the expense of long-term profitability, given the cash comes in up front but the liabilities follow later, while competition can force insurers to match low prices or risk losing business. Insurers have two main sources of profitability: underwriting income (premiums minus operating costs) and investment income or float income. In our view, superior underwriting income is the only true source of a moat. We do not believe insurers can gain a durable advantage through investing, as higher returns are typically just reflective of higher risk or luck. Insurers need to be evaluated over long periods, as volatility is inherent to the industry.While globally diverse across personal and commercial insurance, we estimate that more than 80% of QBEs premiums are generated from specialty insurance lines. While less commodified categories presents an opportunity for the group to demonstrate superior underwriting skills and differentiated offerings, but returns suggest the group has failed to establish a cost advantage needed to warrant a moat rating. QBEs reputation for superior underwriting standards reduced significantly following a string of poor profit results. Between 2013 and 2023, claims costs averaged 65% and the combined operating ratio averaged 97%. This includes an insurance loss in 2017 where the combined operating ratio was 104.5%. There are have been brighter periods where QBEs results supported a case for a moat rating, though. In 2011, QBE incurred a material increase in claims, which put an end a six-year run of claims costs of 60% or lower, and a combined operating ratio that averaged an impressive 88% over the period. While there are signs of improvement that we expect will lead to the insurer generating returns in excess of its cost of equity over the next five years, given its record, we are not confident this is maintainable over the next 10 years. The firms global acquisition growth strategy failed to deliver an improvement in return on equity over a long period, with a scattershot approach across different regions and insurance lines ultimately resulting in increased volatility and poor operating performance. A change of CEO in 2012 put an end to the acquisition-led strategy that put premium growth at its core. Since 2015, QBE has made a number of divestments and exited underperforming lines where the group lacked scale and could not deliver acceptable returns. In 2018, QBE sold its entire Latin America business as well as operations in Thailand, Indonesia, and the Philippines. QBE also exited loss-making portfolios including North American personal lines, Hong Kong construction workers' compensation, and Australian and New Zealand travel insurance. An increased focus on the basics of underwriting standards, customer experience, and operating efficiency has seen claims and profit margins trend in the right direction.Size comes with some benefits. Primarily, it helps insurers lower costs by scaling their business through an effective distribution platform. While marketing and technology spending is shared, the need for specialized underwriters across numerous insurance lines and regions has limited scalability. To QBEs credit, the combined operating ratio has been below 100% for all but two of the last 15 years. It was a different story between 1998 and 2001, with four consecutive years of insurance losses. While market share varies across product lines, QBEs premiums in North America are dwarfed by Chubb and Zurich. Both of these narrow-moat-rated competitors have a greater chance of building a competitive advantage based on scale. In North America, QBEs largest product line is crop insurance, accounting for over half the region's gross written premiums. QBE competes with other large insurers such as Chubb, Zurich, CGB Insurance, and Great American Insurance Group. In Australia and New Zealand, the general insurance market is dominated by a handful of large players: Insurance Australia Group, Suncorp, QBE, and Allianz. In Australia and New Zealand, around 43% of QBEs premiums are generated from commercial and domestic property, with motor and personal injury another 23%. Even in the more profitable Australia and New Zealand region we do not believe the cost base or underwriting record are enough to support a narrow economic moat rating. In fact, analysis of the Australian market provides evidence that much smaller competitors have shown an ability to match the underwriting expense ratio (operating expenses/net earned premium) of the market leaders. In Australia and New Zealand, QBE has a much larger exposure to personal insurance lines in comparison to other regions, and smaller competitors with more narrow distribution focuses are successfully taking share profitably. Hollard demonstrated it is possible to expand market share with sharp pricing and much leaner cost bases in the direct and private-label channels. White labeling for Virgin Money, ING, Woolworths, Qantas, and Medibank provides access to large existing customer bases that can be targeted with special deals, as well as market insurance products more broadly without needing to invest heavily in a new brand. A focus on lower-risk customers could be contributing and limit the insurers ability to maintain current loss rates and grow share simultaneously. Low claims expense ratios lead us to conclude competitors are not taking additional risk. QBE is one of Australias largest players in the lenders mortgage insurance market, with Helia Group (no-moat-rated), Arch Capital Group, and the captive insurer owned by ANZ Banking Group rounding out the concentrated market. Despite its large market share and concentrated nature of the industry we do not see this small contributor to group earnings as moaty either. The superior negotiating power of its main customers, dominated by Australias wide-moat-rated major banks, the availability of alternatives to lenders mortgage insurance for managing default risk, and potential for large capital destruction in a severe economic downturn make it extremely difficult to establish a persistent competitive advantage.","Key downside risks include unexpected increases in underlying claims and natural peril costs above reinsurance allowances. QBE has a patchy record of underwriting profitability, with periods of growth and strong profitability followed by write-downs and increased provisions. Some of this risk is largely out of QBEs hands, such as more frequent large hazard events. Its often not the size of a catastrophe which dents earnings, given reinsurance arrangements, but the frequency. Diversification can reduce risks by spreading exposures by product and geography.Investment returns on policyholder and shareholder funds make up a sizable component of earnings, leaving the business vulnerable to changes in equity market and fixed income returns. In a dire situation, debt issuer defaults are also possible, which negatively affect earnings but also could also necessitate a dilutive equity raising. Premium income sourced offshore means earnings are exposed to currency volatility (primarily the U.S. dollar, euro, and British pound).Other operational risks are incorrect forecasts of insurance claims liabilities, weak economic conditions depressing new business, and increased competitive pressures reducing premium rates. Adverse regulatory and legislative reform is an ever-present external risk.We believe taking all these factors into consideration makes a Morningstar Uncertainty Rating of High most appropriate.QBE's environmental, social, and governance risks primarily relate to climate change, which could increase the frequency and intensity of natural disasters. We think insurers will be able to increase premiums accordingly to offset higher costs though, as all competitors will be facing the same margin headwinds. We therefore don't incorporate ESG risks into our base case.","We assign QBE Insurance a Standard Capital Allocation Rating. QBE is financially sound. The insurer targets to hold 1.6-1.8 times its prescribed capital amount. As at Dec. 31, 2023, QBE had a PCA ratio of 1.8 times. QBEs recent record of buying back shares then raising equity at a much lower price is not great. In February 2017, QBE announced a three-year cumulative off-market share buyback. QBE spent AUD 767 million purchasing 68.1 million shares, or 5% of issued capital. As economic conditions changed abruptly in 2020, QBE opted to shore up its balance sheet, issuing 158 million shares and raising around AUD 1.3 billion. We estimate an average buyback price of AUD 11.26 per share, compared with the institutional component of the equity raise, which was priced at AUD 8.25 per share. QBE raised equity at a material 31% discount to our fair value estimate in 2020, which resulted in an 8% reduction to our valuation. At least those who participated in the relatively small share-purchase plan, priced at AUD 7.51, are today sitting on a large gain at current prices.We believe the dividend payout ratio of 40%-60% of cash profit is reasonable, retaining capital for periods of worse-than-expected claims and supporting growth in premiums. After a multidecade strategy of growth by acquisition, a much-needed period of consolidation has included the exit from Latin America, North American personal lines, a number of Asian markets where the group lacks scale, and underwriting agencies and travel insurance in Australia and New Zealand. We like the focus and results of bringing down the attritional claims ratio (ordinary claims before large events) and operating expenses. ","QBE Insurance is an international property and casualty insurance company. It writes around 25% of its annual gross written premiums in its home region of Australia and New Zealand.

23,22/02/2024,Narrow-Moat Monster Poised to Expand Volume With Innovation Pipeline and Coca-Cola Alliance,Monster Beverage Corp,MNST,2,,Dan Su,55.14,USD,21/02/2024,50.0,Medium,Narrow,Standard,A,,,"Strong energy drink demand, coupled with Monsters strong innovation pipeline, bodes well for high-single-digit top-line growth in the coming years.  Monster has broadened its appeal to health-conscious consumers with better-for-you drinks, including zero sugar, zero calorie offerings and beverages containing only natural ingredients.  Monster stands to gain volume share as the maker of rival brand Bang (with high-single-digit volume share in the U.S.) filed for bankruptcy in 2022. ","Regulatory scrutiny and administrative restrictions in the U.S. and Europe will likely persist and erode Monsters brand intangibles and retail demand.  PepsiCo has stepped up investments in its own energy drink portfolio, posing threats to Monsters dominance in North America.  The firm faces an uphill battle to advance its low-single-digit volume share in Asia-Pacific (35% of global energy drink demand) given stiff competition from Red Bulls sister company T.C. Pharmaceutical and other well-established local brands. ",26/11/2023,"Although not the pioneer in energy drinks, Monster has earned its perch in this attractive category through innovations that resonate with consumers and effective marketing that keeps its core brand top of mind. The long-term strategic alliance with wide-moat Coca-Cola, effective since 2015, further advances Monsters competitive standing, affording the firm impressive distribution breath and product availability that is hard to match by rivals. As such, we award a narrow economic moat rating for Monster.  We see Monster as remaining well positioned to capitalize on favorable energy drink demand in the coming years, thanks to a sharpened focus on user activation and retention by expanding consumption occasions and adding better-for-you options, including zero sugar versions of its classic recipes and plant-based drinks. In addition, we expect Monsters efforts to reach more untapped consumers in vast emerging markets across Latin America and Eastern Europe to receive stronger support from the Coke system, now that Coca-Cola has scrapped its own energy offerings following a lackluster response. Monster has a two-pronged strategy in place, maintaining a premium positioning for the core Monster trademark in the modern retail and convenience channels, while rolling out Predator and Fury brands at more affordable price points to tap consumers not as well-heeled as the traditional Monster demographic. We believe the Coke systems close ties with the traditional trade will be particularly helpful to this affordability endeavor.  Despite our sanguine view, Monsters growth outlook is not without risks. Regulatory scrutiny and administrative restrictions on caffeine content and marketing constraints remain a threat to Monsters brand image and volume demand in North America and Western Europe. Competition ferocity is on the rise as well, as beverage giant wide-moat PepsiCo brings strong tier-two energy brands onto its own distribution network, while various emerging brands target energy drinkers that look for new fares. That said, we believe Monster is poised to continue thriving thanks to an advantaged competitive position and managements strong execution.  ","We believe Monster Beverage has carved out a narrow economic moat, thanks to strong brand affinity in the energy drink category and extensive distribution reach through a long-term partnership with the Coca-Cola system globally. The brand intangible-driven moat has helped the firm deliver returns on invested capital (including goodwill) that exceeded our estimate of its 7.5% weighted average cost of capital over the past 10 years, and we project excess investment returns to continue over the next decade. That said, Monsters narrow focus on energy drinks (which represent a low-single-digit percentage of overall soft drink volume), regulatory headwinds, and uncertainties surrounding the ultimate renewal of the Coke distribution agreement in 12 years, combine to constrain our confidence in the firms ability to deliver excess returns for more than 20 years. We therefore cap our rating at a narrow moat. Monsters intangible asset-driven moat is premised on the brand equity associated with its namesake Monster trademark. Although launched 15 years behind energy drink pioneer Red Bull, the Monster brand has amassed leading volume share globally (18% versus 14% for Austria-based Red Bull GmbH, according to Euromonitor). And in its core North America market, where Monster generates two thirds of its revenue, the brand holds a whopping 46% volume share, far outpacing Red Bull at just 25%. We attribute this to Monsters constant stream of innovation that resonates with consumers and a series of high-profile sports sponsorships, including Nascar and MotoGP World Championship, that serve to keep its brand top of mind with consumers.We see structural factors in the $78 billion global energy drink category that are conducive to Monsters brand equity. Favorable volume trends (averaging 6% in the U.S. over the past decade, versus 2% in the overall soft drink sphere) fueled by demand from busy consumers looking for a quick and convenient energy boost have enabled top brands like Monster to increase sales and brand awareness with more productive spending in advertising and marketing. Based on our calculation, each incremental dollar that Monster spent on advertising and marketing drove $13.10 in increased revenue on average over the past five years, ahead of its larger nonalcoholic beverage peers Coca-Cola ($12.00), PepsiCo ($11.40), and Keurig Dr Pepper ($10.20). Moreover, brand differentiation is largely based on perceived functional benefits (such as mental alertness and improved energy level) and to a lesser extent flavor profiles, which underpin consumer loyalty and repeat purchase frequency, thus private-label penetration is low in energy drinks, at low single digits versus the midteens or low-20s common in the domestic consumer goods sphere. As a result, Monster has been able to grow volumes at midteens rates annually over the past five years while keeping prices flat. Even though the firm does not publish retail-level product pricing information to facilitate an analysis of pricing trends, wed point to Monsters high gross margins (averaging 57% over the past five years, comparable with Coca-Cola at 60.1% and PepsiCo at 54.2%), as a strong indication of consumers willingness to pay a premium. We also view Monsters success over the years in adding new product lines and pricing ladders under the Monster banner as evidence of its brand prowess in engaging and maintaining its loyal customer base. Ten product lines have been added to the Monster franchise over the past 20 years, including Monster Super Fuel (containing magnesium and electrolytes for workout enthusiasts), bubbly Juice Monster with various fruit flavors, non-carbonated tea-flavored Monster Rehab, and coffee-infused dairy-based Java Monster. We believe these line extensions have expanded consumption occasions and created more buzz for the existing consumer community while broadening the palate appeal to convert new customers to the trademark in the U.S. and internationally. In addition to the Monster trademark, we see the firms distribution agreement with Coke as the second pillar to our economic moat rating. Effective since 2015, the initial 20-year partnership has essentially made Monster the exclusive energy play in the Coke system, giving Monster invaluable access to Cokes extensive distribution footprint in the U.S. and internationally, while enabling Coke to benefit from Monsters strong volume growth in terms of distribution density to help offset stagnating trends in Cokes core soda business. The tie-up has accelerated Monsters share gains, enabling the firm to further distance itself from Red Bull in North America and to narrow the gap materially in Western Europe. According to Euromonitor, Monsters global volume share received an immediate lift following the agreement, expanding to 17% in 2016 (compared with 13% in 2014), and continued to tick up steadily in the following years to reach 18% by 2022. In comparison, Red Bull GmbHs volume share has stagnated at around 14% over the past decade, which we attribute to conservative product and marketing strategies from the family-owned business. Although Coke launched energy drinks under its own Coke trademark in 2020 in an attempt to go it alone, the product line was discontinued within 18 months due to weak performance. We believe Cokes short-lived endeavor has reaffirmed the strength of the Monster franchise, and we expect the Coke system to reinforce its commitment to the leading energy drink brand. Aided by the Coke system, the Monster products are now sold in over 140 countries and territories around the world, affording brand recognition and product accessibility that is hard to match by its energy drink peers. Over the next 10 years, we think the Coke relationship should deliver more volume upside, particularly in emerging markets such as Latin America, where energy drink consumption volume remains low (at 8% of global volume, versus a 14% share in the overall soft drink aisle). These growth initiatives, which dovetail well with Cokes strategic priorities of tapping consumption upgrade tailwinds in these regions, should drive another leg of volume growth for Monster, supporting our mid-single-digit volume projection for the firm (ahead of the low-single-digit rate we forecast for the overall nonalcoholic beverages). As energy drinks remain a niche in the broader soft drink space (low-single-digit volume share), we dont think Monster benefits from a cost advantage given its negligible scale relative to beverage behemoths such as wide-moats Coke and PepsiCo. Monster has little bargaining power in sourcing ingredients (sweeteners, vitamins, and flavors) or packaging materials (aluminum, PET, and paper cartons) given the substantial overlap with the purchasing baskets of much larger beverage peers. Also, with packaging and distribution outsourced to third-party copackers, bottlers, and distributors, Monster has little wiggle room in negotiating reduced per unit costs. Moreover, its advertising and marketing budget of approximately $460 million in 2022 (7% of sales) is a fraction of the $4.3 billion at Coke (10%) and $5.2 billion at PepsiCo (6%), putting the firm at a disadvantage in bidding for sports and music event sponsorships or securing a popular time slot in broadcast media campaigns. While we see strong evidence of brand intangibles and extensive distribution via the Coke partnership that underpin a durable competitive position, our confidence in Monsters ability to deliver excess investment returns for over 20 years is constrained by the firms narrow focus on the energy drink category, ongoing regulatory scrutiny, and potential restrictive measures for energy drink makers (such as reduced caffeine content, marketing venue restrictions, or even minimum age requirements for purchase). Furthermore, the Coke distribution agreement is up for renewal in 12 years (2035), which introduces further uncertainties around the continuity of the partnership and the economic terms. As such, we view a narrow economic moat as appropriate for Monster. ","We assign a Medium Uncertainty Rating to Monster Beverage. The company is exposed to regulatory scrutiny and administrative restrictions that may erode the brand perception and retail demand. A narrow focus on energy drinks further exposes the firm to material and sudden demand shifts away from this category. Monster also faces competitive threats in the energy drink sphere led by PepsiCo and in the malt beverage category where Monster has weak brand perception and distributor relationships. Outsourced manufacturing and distribution make Monster vulnerable to disruptions in third-party co-packing and distribution capacity that could result in production delays and inflated costs. While distribution risks are likely under control due to its alliance with the Coke system and the latters distribution scale, it will remain a challenge for the firm to secure reliable third-party co-packers in emerging markets where the firm looks to ramp up volume. On sourcing, Monsters recent entry into craft beer brewing may subject it to low availability of rare hops (for premium beers) that affects the brewing schedule and output. In addition, we expect the firm to constantly contend with tight aluminum can supply as more beverage makers adapt to increasing preference for this packaging among environmentally conscious consumers.The highly visible Monster trademark is constantly under the scrutiny of consumers given the ubiquity of mobile phones and social media. Any brand messaging, consumer experience, social, or sustainability practice that is perceived to be inconsistent with the companys positioning could be brought into the limelight. Without a timely and appropriate response, brand damage and a hit to volume demand and pricing power could ensue. That said, we dont expect environmental, social, and governance risks will materially affect Monster operational results and investment returns long term. ","We assign a Standard capital allocation rating to Monster, based on our view that the company has a strong balance sheet, a fair track record of investments for long-term value creation, and an appropriate shareholder distribution practice with stock buybacks. First, we view Monster as in solid financial health. Its balance sheet is strong, with no long-term debt and $3 billion in cash and short-term investments as of September 2023. This, coupled with steady free cash flow to equity over the next 10 years (averaging 25% of sales), gives us confidence that the company is positioned well to withstand macro volatilities and to invest for long-term growth. On the investment front, capital outlays for organic growth have been the priority, with the firm spending an average of 8% of sales on marketing and advertising over the past five years, though just 2% on capital expenditure as the firm outsources the bulk of manufacturing and distribution. We expect the firm to maintain investments in advertising at similar levels over the next 10 years, while ticking up spending in capacity to 2.5% of sales due to investments in brewing and warehousing capabilities for the newly acquired malt beverage business. We believe these investments are crucial to maintaining the firms long-term competitive position and supporting revenue growth. Monster only made two sizable acquisitions over the past 10 years, namely the $690 million purchase of major flavor supplier American Fruits & Flavors (AFF) in 2016 and the $330 million deal buying California-based craft brewer CANarchy in 2022. Given that AFF contributes under 1% of operating profits to Monster, we believe the transaction is most likely a strategic one to lock in high-quality fruit ingredients and flavors that help differentiate Monster from peers. Regarding the CANarchy acquisition in 2022, we think the firm is prudently diversifying into the alcoholic beverage category for new avenues of growth and, if successful, should alleviate investor concern about Monsters narrow focus on energy drinks. That said, given Monsters lack of well-known malt beverage brands and stiff competition led by entrenched players, including Constellation, AB InBev, and Boston Beer, Monster will need to invest heavily in marketing and distributor relationship building for several years at least before generating tangible benefits from the acquisition. For now, its too early to assess whether the deal can add to the firms overall investment returns. We believe the swap of Monsters nonenergy assets for Cokes seven-brand energy drink portfolio in 2015 (as part of the long-term partnership agreement) was an important transaction as well, which helped to cement Monsters status as the exclusive energy play in the Coke system and eliminated potential conflicts of interests between the two partners. However, the price tag for the Coke assets was undisclosed, making it impossible for us to quantify investment returns from this deal. On shareholder distributions, Monster has not paid any cash dividends since inception and has no such plans in the foreseeable future. However, the company did return more than $5 billion in cash to shareholders since 2012 via share buybacks. As of March 2023, repurchase plans authorized by the board had a remaining balance of $680 million. We expect the firm to continue with share buybacks in the coming years, though we stick to our view that buybacks create value for shareholders only when executed at market prices below our assessment of intrinsic value, and its not necessary to commit to a fixed target amount. ","Monster Beverage is a leader in the energy drink subsegment of the nonalcoholic beverage market, generating two thirds of revenue in the U.S. and Canada. The well-known Monster trademark includes brands such as Monster Energy, Monster Ultra, Java Monster, and Juice Monster. The firm also owns other energy drink brands, such as Reign, NOS, Burn, and Mother, and brews and distributes beers and flavored malt beverages following the acquisition of a craft brewer in 2022. Monster controls branding and innovation but outsources beverage manufacturing and packaging to copackers and finished goods distribution to bottlers in the global Coca-Cola system (pursuant to a 20-year agreement inked in 2015). Coke is the largest shareholder of Monster with a 19.5% stake. ","We believe Monster Beverage has a pristine balance sheet and sufficient liquidity to weather macro volatilities and invest for long-term growth. The company had $3 billion in cash and short-term investments on its balance sheet as of September 2023, no outstanding balance under a $15 million credit facility, and no long-term debt. Unless the firm contemplates a major acquisition that necessitates debt financing in the future (unlikely in our view), we expect the capital structure to remain heavily skewed to equity. Cash generation is strong, with free cash flows to equity averaging 23% of sales over the past five years on the back of steady top-line growth, strong margins, and management discipline in capital expenditure. As the firm continues to optimize operational efficiency, works down its aluminum can inventory buildup driven by supply chain disruptions in recent years, and cost inflation in ingredients, packaging, and freight revert to their long-term averages in the coming years (as we expect), we have modeled Monster to maintain cash generation averaging 25% of sales over the next 10 years.

24,22/02/2024,FactSets Recurring Revenue Model Fares Well but Is Not Immune to Macroenvironment Volatility,FactSet Research Systems Inc,FDS,2,,Rajiv Bhatia,453.35,USD,21/02/2024,390.0,Medium,Narrow,Standard,A,,,"FactSet has done a good job of increasing organic annual subscription value and incrementally gaining market share.  FactSet's data feed and wealth management businesses represent strong growth opportunities for the firm. While organic operating margins have been range-bound, a higher revenue base may make operating margin expansion more attainable in the future.","FactSet's customer base of asset owners and asset managers could face pressure, and a drop in equity markets could weigh on customer budgets. In addition, investment banks face pressure from soft deal activity.  While data feeds represent a growth opportunity, the business is about 25% of FactSet's revenue. FactSet faces competition from well-established players such as Refinitiv, Bloomberg, MSCI, and S&P Global, as well as software and financial technology upstarts.",05/01/2024,"FactSet has built an attractive subscription-based business providing data and analytics to the financial-services industry. FactSet is best known for its research solutions, which include its core desktop offering geared toward buy-side asset managers and sell-side investment bankers. Research is the largest component of the firms annual subscription value but is FactSets slowest-growing segment due to its maturity and pressures on asset managers. Beyond research, FactSet offers analytics and trading solutions (32% of firm ASV), which include portfolio analytics, risk management, performance reporting, trade execution, and order management. FactSet's fastest-growing segment is its data feed business, known as content and technology solutions, which makes up 25% of ASV, including CUSIP Global Services. Users of CTS access data through feeds or application programming interfaces. Through repurposing its research and analytics capabilities, FactSet has built software products suitable for financial advisors. FactSets adjusted operating margins have been range-bound (31%-36%) over the last 10 years as the firm continues to invest in new content. We believe this is prudent as investments have historically allowed FactSet to take share from competitors such as Refinitiv. However, we do expect some margin expansion as the company increases scale and CFO Linda Huber takes a disciplined approach on expenses. FactSet has mostly grown organically and its acquisition strategy has mostly focused on adding an additional data source or software capability. In March 2022, FactSet completed its purchase of CUSIP from S&P Global for $1.9 billion, its largest acquisition to date.  Given consolidation in the financial technology industry, FactSet could become an acquisition target. The industry has seen large deals such as LSE Group acquiring Refinitiv and S&P Global acquiring IHS Markit. We believe FactSets recurring revenue model would be attractive to potential acquirers, but its valuation and heightened antitrust scrutiny could be a challenge.","Overall, we believe FactSet warrants a narrow economic moat rating based on switching costs. FactSet provides its integrated financial information and analytical applications across four workflows: research, analytics and trading, content and technology solutions, and wealth. FactSet's research workflow includes its core desktop offering used by buy-side and sell-side investment professionals to analyze companies, monitor markets, and generate ideas. FactSets desktops consist of aggregated data from third-party data suppliers, news sources, exchanges, brokerages, and its own contributions. FactSet faces competitors such as S&P Capital IQ, Refinitiv, and, at the high end, Bloomberg. While FactSet may have some proprietary data (supply chain, geographic revenue mix, and so on), we believe the proprietary data offerings can depreciate over time as suitable alternatives are developed. In addition, we believe some of these data sets fall in the nice to have rather than mission critical category for a subset of FactSets users. As a result, we view the primary moat source for its research desktops as switching costs. Once an analyst or company is familiar with a certain product, switching to a new product can be disruptive. FactSet's analytics and trading solutions include portfolio analytics, risk management, performance measurement and attribution, portfolio construction and trade execution/order management. We view FactSets closest competitors as MSCI, Qontigo (Deutsche Boerse), Aladdin (BlackRock), Bloomberg, and Charles River Development (State Street). Given the embedded nature of software systems in buy-side operations, the decision to switch providers is not taken lightly as implementations can be hard and complex. That said, MSCI has seen some competitive losses in part due to price. As a result, we believe switching costs are high enough to warrant a narrow moat.CTS is FactSets data feed business and includes its acquisition of CUSIP Global Services. Rather than content being delivered through a desktop application, it is delivered through data feeds or through application programming interfaces. An example would be a quant fund using FactSet data to input into an algorithm. While FactSet has seen strong growth, competitors such as S&P have too, and while switching costs are real, we dont believe they are strong enough to generate a wide moat. Wealth management has been a focus for FactSet in recent years as the company has been able to take its research content and repackage it for financial advisors. On the positive side, wealth managers are an attractive segment, given the limited fee pressure they face. On the negative side, wealth managers willingness and ability to pay is more limited, and as a result, wealth management desktops tend to be at a much lower price point versus institutional-focused research desktops. FactSet has seen some nice wins such as Merrill Lynch, but overall, we believe this segment remains competitive with established players such as Refinitiv and upstarts such as YCharts.","We give FactSet a Medium Morningstar Uncertainty Rating.FactSet is exposed to hiring levels and budgets of the buy-side investment management industry. Staffing levels of buy-side investment firms affects the firms monetization of its per license revenue. In addition, FactSets software solutions face competitive pressures from other providers, such as Axioma, Aladdin, and Bloomberg. About 18% of FactSets revenue is from sell-side investment banks, which also tends to show some cyclicality. In our view, FactSets risks are mitigated by the fact that client concentration remains low. FactSets largest client accounts for about 3% of revenue. FactSets products are dependent on third-party data suppliers. FactSet seeks to maintain at least two content providers for each major type of data where possible.From an environmental, social, and governance perspective, we believe risks are modest. We view the largest risks as stemming from business ethics as well as product governance issues. FactSet operates in multiple countries and is exposed to economic, cultural, and political risks in those countries. Given the data-intensive nature of its business, FactSet is exposed to data security risks. In our view, management has managed ESG risks well, and we believe incidents related to ESG risks have been lower at FactSet than its peers. ","Overall, we believe FactSet merits a Standard Capital Allocation Rating. In our opinion, the companys balance sheet is financially sound. As of Aug. 31, 2023, FactSet had net debt of $1.2 billion. This represents a net leverage ratio of less than 2 times, which we believe is appropriate for the firms business model. Thanks to investing in its platform and strong customer service, FactSet has been able to take market share from other incumbents, such as Refinitiv, and thus were pleased with its internal investments. FactSets acquisitions have seemed strategically appropriate and have ranged from smaller tuck-ins to more meaningful bolt-on deals. We view the firms capital returns strategy as appropriate. FactSet typically increases its dividend each year, maintaining a payout ratio in the 20%-30% on a GAAP basis. FactSets remaining earnings are then typically used for share repurchases and bolt-on acquisitions. However, in the near term, we expect FactSet to focus on paying down debt it incurred for the CUSIP acquisition. Philip Snow became CEO in July 2015. Shortly into his tenure, FactSet acquired Portware for $265 million; this was its largest acquisition at the time, but with only about $41 million in ASV, it increased FactSets revenue by less than 5%. Since then, FactSet has made additional acquisitions of Vermilion, BISAM, and Interactive Data Managed Solutions while selling Market Metrics and Matrix Solutions. Overall, we dont view these acquisitions as transformative and in our view don't materially affect the firms economic moat. In October 2021, Linda Huber became the firm's CFO; we view this as incremental positive as we view her tenure at Moody's favorably. Though the acquisition of CUSIP was not cheap, we believe the strategic rationale was sound and expect the deal to be accretive to earnings. To management's credit, this deal was largely financed by fixed-rate debt when interest rates were low. ","FactSet provides financial data and portfolio analytics to the global investment community. The company aggregates data from third-party data suppliers, news sources, exchanges, brokerages, and contributors into its workstations. In addition, it provides essential portfolio analytics that companies use to monitor portfolios and address reporting requirements. Buy-side clients account for 82% of FactSet's annual subscription value. In 2015, the company acquired Portware, a provider of trade execution software. In 2017, it acquired BISAM, a risk management and performance measurement provider. In 2022, it completed its purchase of CUSIP Global Services.","As of Aug. 31, 2023, FactSet had gross debt of $1.6 billion and net debt of $1.2 billion. FactSet incurred debt to fund its acquisition of CUSIP Global Services in early 2022; prior to that, it had no net debt. At current levels, the company has a net debt/EBITDA ratio of less than 2 times, which we believe is appropriate. While historically FactSet has not been shy about returning capital to shareholders in the form of share repurchases, we expect it to focus on paying down debt in the near term. FactSet's revenue is almost all recurring in nature, and as a result, it's weathered the uncertainties of COVID-19 fairly well. FactSet's client retention is typically over 90% as a percentage of clients and 95% as a percentage of ASV. FactSet also has low client concentration (largest client is less than 3% of revenue and we believe the top 10 clients are less than 15% of revenue). In addition, FactSet has diversified its ASV from research desktops to analytics software, wealth management solutions, and data feeds. As a result, we would be comfortable with FactSet increasing its leverage for the right acquisition candidate. While revenue and margins may suffer in a downturn, we're confident that FactSet would still remain profitable."
25,22/02/2024,Near-Term Macro Headwinds Fail to Dampen Lowe's Leading Position in Home Improvement,Lowe's Companies Inc,LOW,3,13/12/2023,Jaime Katz,227.79,USD,21/02/2024,207.0,Medium,Wide,Exemplary,B,13/12/2023,"New-home sales have rebounded since the spring of this year as sales incentives and price reductions have attracted buyers who have fewer options in the supply-constrained existing-home market. That said, homebuilder sentiment data tells us that smaller builders remain cautious. Even so, we forecast single-family starts to increase by 3% in 2024, to 0.92 million units. However, we project this increase in single-family starts will be more than offset by a 24% decline in multifamily starts, to 0.36 million units. Multifamily construction has been robust for the past three years, but a record construction backlog and higher construction and financing costs have tamed developers' appetite for new multifamily projects. All told, we expect total starts to decline 6% in 2024, to 1.31 million. For 2025-26, we expect high-single-digit percentage growth for single-family starts, while multifamily rebounds at a low-single-digit rate. We forecast total housing starts will again eclipse 1.5 million units by 2026. We forecast the median new-home sale price will decline about 5% this year, but homebuilders, which report sale prices net of incentives, will likely report a low-double-digit decline in average selling price for new orders. We expect reduced sales incentives next year as mortgage rates begin to normalize. We forecast the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate will fall to 6.10% in 2024 and 4.75% in 2025. We continue to believe home price appreciation will normalize around 3% over the longer run. Repair and remodel spending has moderated as we expected, and we've maintained our near-term outlook for roughly a 4.5% decline in owner-occupied improvement spending in 2023. While we still expect a modest rebound in R&R spending next year, we now forecast R&R spending will increase 1% instead of 2% as demand for larger, discretionary projects has softened a bit more than we were expecting. Nevertheless, we continue to see a 5% long-term growth trajectory for R&R spending.","We forecast Lowe's to reach a 13.3% operating margin in 2023, after divesting the dilutive Canadian business and investing in productivity efforts. Higher home prices and aging housing stock support demand, generating an estimated cumulative free cash flow to the firm of $46 billion over the next five years, which should help finance nearly $30 billion in repurchases. Perpetual productivity initiatives, which could improve the supply chain and inventory management could boost inventory turnover and working capital generation above levels that we currently anticipate.","The closure of smaller peers may intermittently lead to competitive pricing pressures at Lowe's, constraining ROIC expansion and limiting sales growth. Higher interest rates, flat housing price growth, or tighter lending standards could slow inventory turnover, postponing home improvement projects and hindering Lowe's sales. Lower sales could pressure profitability if lower-margin acquired businesseslike those that compose the Lowe's Pro Supply lineoperate less than optimally. Further margin pressure could ensue if growing pro and MRO demand become difficult.",24/11/2023,"Lowe's is the second-largest home improvement retailer globally, set to capture around $87 billion in sales in fiscal 2023. With continued focus on retail fundamentals (merchandising excellence, operational efficiency, supply chain improvements, omnichannel shopping experience, and customer engagement), Lowe's has been able to better leverage costs while maintaining its low-cost position. The firm retains some of the cost savings and passes the rest on to its customers through everyday low prices. These competitive advantages support our wide economic moat rating. Since Marvin Ellison took the helm in 2018, a full overhaul of Lowe's C-suite, board, and merchandising team has ensued. With an perpetual productivity plan now bearing fruit, incremental profit margin gains should continue. Thanks to the institutionalization of processes that were inefficient (including labor management, reset efforts, and inventory controls), and the divestiture of underperforming lines, the operating margin is now forecast to reach 13.3% in 2023, up from 9.1% in 2019. Additionally, demand in home improvements stemming from an aging housing market, along with still robust home prices supporting a positive wealth effect (despite higher interest rates), positions the firm for further cost leverage. With structural changes that have included the closure of the Orchard Supply brand and the sale of its Mexican and Canadian assets, capital expenditures (estimated at $2 billion in 2023) are likely to focus on efforts that should lead to working capital efficiency gains ahead. Lowe's updated its long-term financial goals in December 2022, which target a long-term operating margin of 14.5% and returns on invested capital of 45%. With the firm expected to reach a 13.3% operating margin and 33% ROICs in 2023 (by our math), we think a progression toward both operating margin and ROICs goals is reasonable given structural changes that have occurred. Lowe's still has opportunities in underserved domestic markets (city, rural) and via wider professional penetration, bolstered by past tie-ups of Maintenance Supply Headquarters and Central Wholesalers (now Lowe's Pro Supply, or LPS).","We assign Lowes a wide economic moat. As the second-largest global home improvement retailer, we believe Lowes will continue to gain incremental share in the North American home improvement retail segment (which Lowe's has estimated at around a $1 trillion market), given its extensive distribution network and economies of scale as well as the brand awareness it has built with consumers and professionals. Dissecting the components of its competitive prowess, Lowe's has been able to capture economic rents from its brand, offering an important intangible asset. This is evidenced in consistent same-store sales growth, which has averaged 7.7% over the past five years (just 90 basis points below its peer Home Depot). Furthermore, continued improvements in merchandising strategy, the supply chain, and a focus on meeting pro consumer demands should support the brand, driving both additional same-store sales growth (3% on average beyond fiscal 2023) and operating margin expansion over the next decade (to 14.5%, near wide-moat Home Depot and up roughly 500 basis points relative to the average margin chalked up in the five years preceding the pandemic). Historically, the business was built on topnotch customer service, knowledge, and innovation, which has let the firm amass around 10% share of the highly fragmented $1 trillion home improvement market (with around $87 billion in 2023 expected sales). The reliability of information that consumers can draw upon from associates is unlikely to be replicated easily; Home Depot is the sole competitor that offers a similar level of knowledge, although Tractor Supply offers consistent service levels in its respective categories. In addition, Lowes has worked hard to ensure that the appropriate staff is on hand to solve any problems that its customers may encounter. Labor has been a core focus of the management team in recent years, with efforts to reallocate 60% of workers to service (40% prior to the change in 2018) rather than stocking hours as a means to increase productivity, which the prior management team had struggled to execute successfully. Leveraging technology has allowed Lowe's to reduce duplicative tasks, perform faster cross-functional training across departments, and strategically deploy its team to eliminate non-productive hours and extract productivity in its stores. The companys strategies have helped it deliver average adjusted returns on invested capital, including goodwill, of 28% over the past five years, significantly higher than our 8% weighted average cost of capital estimate. In our view, ROICs should remain north of our cost of capital over the next 20 years (with ROICs ultimately reaching 41% in 2032), supporting our wide-moat rating. From the brand portfolio perspective, Lowes continues to find new ways to innovate through product launches, private-label and exclusive offerings, and services. Apart from approximately 30 trusted national brands (including Whirlpool, Samsung, GE, DeWalt, and more), Lowes houses 12 private-label brands (including allen+roth, Kobalt, Origin21, among others) that foster consumer loyalty, brand positioning, and margin gain opportunities. This is a particularly lucrative opportunity as we estimate private-label sales boast higher gross margins for Lowes that are a few hundred basis points above national brands (in line with other consumer retail industries). Lowes is pursuing a balanced growth approach, targeting national brand expansion for professional customers (as this cohort tends to rely on national brands for projects), while primarily extending private brands for do-it-yourself and do-it-for-me customers, who tend to be brand agnostic. We contend the familiarity and quality of the brands offered as well as the robust knowledge of the employee base keep the business in the forefront of consumers' minds as the premier choice for home improvement needs, and we believe the specialized nature of Lowe's offerings provides some protection from mass merchants and large online retailers (which could find it difficult to capture better pricing). Evidence of recent brand strength stems from outstanding average ticket growth of 7% on average over the past five fiscal years. Apart from its brand intangible asset, we think the company's size (operating more than 1,700 stores throughout the United States) has allowed for significant bargaining power with vendors when sourcing products, crafting advertisements, and arranging logistics (among other things). As a low cost one-stop shop for any home improvement need, Lowe's provides value and instills customer loyalty by passing along a portion of these savings in the form of everyday low pricing, EDLP. The ability to apply EDLP tactics is a result of negotiating clout due to scale as savings from bulk purchases allow for this pricing mechanism. And we think EDLP drives a positive flywheel effect, keeping customers more likely to return as they understand the value proposition offered by the company driving further scale gains. As evidence, Lowes recorded total transactions of 937 million in 2022, from 878 million in 2015 (up 6.7%) and average ticket has risen to $103.64 from $67.26 over the same time frame (up 54%). Additionally, we assess the pricing strategy as successful given the stability of gross margins, which have clocked in the 33% range since 2018a level we believe should persist as any scale benefits gained are likely to pass directly to consumers given the EDLP strategy. Furthermore, we think the company can build on its cost advantage through increasing speed in the supply chain, leveraging payroll, lowering operating expenses by improving inventory management (turns), and consolidating the procurement of some goods and services across the corporate and store channels. These efforts should compress selling, general, and administrative, SG&A, spend to 17.1% of sales by the end of our forecast, from 18.4% in 2022. All in, these factors should lead to an operating margin of 14.5% in 2032 (up from 13% in 2022). With consumers increasingly favoring retailers with a robust omnichannel presence, manufacturers without such capabilities to offer a seamless multichannel shopping experience could struggle to attract customers. We surmise around half of e-commerce transactions (which represented a low-double-digit percentage of 2022 sales) at Lowes were ordered online and picked up in store, implying more than $10 billion worth of goods stemmed from an omnichannel transaction over the year. For perspective, online penetration was just around 5% in 2018, but we expect it can continue to expand to a low- to midteens rate in the near term as buy online pickup in store and other omnichannel efforts are adopted more widely by the professional consumer base. From our vantage point, this offering should prompt further market share gains, with our forecast calling for the firm to garner a 13%-14% market share over the next decade.In our opinion, it would be difficult for another retailer to enter the market and threaten Lowes position, as smaller retailers would have a hard time building vendor relationships strong enough to undermine the companys pricing prowess. While the threat of manufacturers creating their own retail network could jeopardize the availability of product in Lowes retail channel, we doubt such an endeavor would be successful in the longer term. In our opinion, manufacturers would be poised to move more product by maintaining a beneficial relationship with a wholesale network like Lowes, rather than on their own; additionally, we expect that consumers would still prefer to save time and effort by visiting one shop for all of a projects needs, rather than purchasing products separately from each manufacturer.","We assign Lowe's a Medium Uncertainty Rating due to its strong brand recognition, which has helped stabilize sales through the cycle. Lowe's operates in a cyclical retail environment in which sales are driven in large part by homeowners' spending. With still-elevated existing-home prices (and thus elevated home equity) and higher interest rates, a modest slowdown in repair and remodel spending has ensued. However, if interest rates stay higher for longer than we anticipate, uncertainty around the direction of the economic environment could continue to temper discretionary spend broadly (recently displayed by consumers trading down to smaller ticket projects). Turnover of homes is a key factor driving home improvement spend. Existing home sales growth had stabilized at the beginning of 2020 until COVID-19 struck, sending existing-home sales tumbling at a double-digit pace between April and June 2020, before achieving a consistent recovery. However, existing home sales have contracted meaningfully in recent months, and any additional economic headwinds, like spike in unemployment, predatory pricing tactics, or slowdown in consumer confidence could reduce revenue and profitability. Additionally, in our opinion, Lowe's has only minimal environmental, social, and governance risk. While there is some risk associated with product sourcing and potential data theft, the biggest issue we foresee on the horizon is in consumer's shifting preferences to maintainable product offerings. We expect Lowe's to adapt, and as such, do not see any material financial impact from such exposure.","Our capital allocation rating for Lowe's is Exemplary. Forecast adjusted returns on invested capital including goodwill (35% on average over the next five years) are set to handily outpace our weighted cost of capital estimate (at 8%) over our entire outlook. Additionally, the balance sheet remains sound, given the company's medium revenue cyclicality and decent operating leverage. A manageable level of debt is coming due over the next few years, and as such, we aren't concerned with capital demands. With net debt/EBITDA that should average around 2 times over the next decade, there is some financial flexibility on the balance sheet.From a leadership perspective, significant management changes had occurred on the heels of D.E. Shaw taking a position in Lowe's (2017), with three new board members initially appointed to the business. Since the beginning of 2018, Lowes hired a new CEO, new chief digital officer (from Amazon), as well as heads of merchandising (Chevron), stores (J.C. Penney, Home Depot), and supply chain (Walmart), and a new CFO (internal succession). Marvin Ellison took the reins from longtime CEO Robert Niblock in July 2018 and brought a tremendous amount of retail knowledge to the business, having previously held the role of CEO of J.C. Penney and acting as a longtime executive at wide-moat peer Home Depot.We hold a positive view on Lowe's investment strategy, as we think it is spending strategically to maintain its competitive advantages and respond rapidly to evolving consumer demand patterns. Quantitatively, we believe this is supported by robust ROIC and improving operating margin performance (reaches 14.5% over our forecast).Furthermore, we deem cash distributions as appropriate, with the management team returning capital to shareholders when optimal. As such, it suspended share repurchases early in the COVID-19 cycle but restarted opportunistic purchases in the final quarter of 2020) thanks to the strong demand that has persisted during the pandemic. Lowe's has consistently raised its dividend in recent years, and we expect it will continue to do so ahead, further returning excess capital to shareholders.","Lowe's is the second-largest home improvement retailer in the world, operating more than 1,700 stores in the United States, after the 2023 divestiture of its Canadian locations (RONA, Lowes Canada, Rno-Dpt, and Dicks Lumber). The firms stores offer products and services for home decorating, maintenance, repair, and remodeling, with maintenance and repair accounting for two thirds of products sold. Lowe's targets retail do-it-yourself (around 75% of sales) and do-it-for-me customers as well as commercial and professional business clients (around 25% of sales). We estimate Lowe's captures a low-double-digit share of the domestic home improvement market, based on U.S. Census data and managements market size estimates.","Despite increasing leverage in recent years, the debt/total capital ratio remained around a midteen percentage, and we believe the company is in decent financial health thanks to the robust free cash flow it generates. Debt maturities are spread out evenly, and we do not believe they will present any cash flow issues. The firm easily covers net interest expense around 11 times with its earnings before interest and tax (2022). The firm raised nearly $10 billion in 2022 for general corporate purposes (it expects to increase net debt by $7 billion between 2023 and 2025). Management's net debt/EBITDAR target remains at 2.75 times, a level metric Lowe's should easily remain within over the next five years. For reference, Home Depot's net debt/EBITDAR target is 2 times.Lowe's generated average annual free cash flow to the firm of $8.3 billion over the past five years as the housing market remained healthy. We believe this level of robust free cash flow helps to support the company's $36 billion long-term debt load along with $3.6 billion in noncurrent operating lease liabilities. Lowe's resumed share repurchases in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2020 (after halting payment earlier in 2020 in response to COVID-19 uncertainty), allowing the firm to buy back $5 billion in shares during 2020. Lowe's followed up with another $13 billion in repurchases in 2021 and $14 billion in 2022. We model roughly $19 billion in share repurchases between 2023 and 2025 as free cash flow remains robust. Lowe's owns most of its stores, and the balance sheet has $17.5 billion in net property, plant, and equipment, providing an asset base to secure debt if necessary."
26,22/02/2024,"Under Armour Lacks an Advantage, but the Global Sportswear Market Remains Dynamic",Under Armour Inc,UAA,5,,David Swartz,8.27,USD,21/02/2024,15.5,High,None,Standard,C,,,"Under Armour has implemented a plan called Protect This House 3 that could make it more competitive. It has introduced a loyalty program, is upgrading its digital capabilities, and is introducing more stylish merchandise. Under Armours restructuring has produced an average annual savings of $200 million. The firm can reinvest these savings into marketing and international expansion while improving its operating margins. Under Armour could gain shelf space and distribution as Nike has reduced or eliminated shipments to some major sportswear retailers.","Inflation and slowing consumer spending on activewear have impeded Under Armours turnaround efforts. Under Armour is exposed to struggling physical retail through its sizable U.S. wholesale business. Some department and sporting goods stores have shuttered locations in recent years. We expect much of Under Armours growth to come from international markets where the brand is little known. It may struggle to compete in China, the worlds second-largest activewear market.",14/02/2024,"We view Under Armour as lacking a moat, given its failure to build a competitive advantage over other athletic apparel firms. Between 2008 and 2016, the firms North American sales increased to $4 billion from $700 million and it passed narrow-moat Adidas as the regions second-largest athletic apparel brand (after wide-moat Nike). However, Under Armours North America sales are little changed over the past seven years as it has been challenged by established competitors and new entrants. While Under Armours new Protect This House 3 plan is designed to make the brand more competitive in the U.S. through its merchandising, e-commerce, and supply chain efforts, we think it has fallen behind some peers on innovation, sponsorships, and style.  Under Armour has recently had problems in both its direct-to-consumer and wholesale businesses. Although annual sales through its direct-to-consumer channels increased to about $2.3 billion in fiscal 2023 from $1.5 billion in 2016, wide-moat Nike and others experienced much greater direct-to-consumer growth in this period. Under Armour has opened its own stores as wholesale distribution has slowed, but 90% of them in North America are off-price. Still, we forecast its direct-to-consumer revenue will rise to 50% of total revenue in fiscal 2033 from 38% in its last fiscal year. This evolution should allow Under Armour to have better control over its brand, but we do not see evidence that it allows for premium pricing and see it as a defensive move. We think Under Armours international segment ($2 billion in sales in fiscal 2023) will produce growth over the long term, but the firm faces significant competition from global and native operators with established brands and distribution networks. According to Euromonitor, the combined sportswear markets in Asia-Pacific and Western Europe totaled about $171 billion at retail in 2023, greater than North America's $158 billion. As Under Armour generated only about 31% of its revenue in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa and Asia-Pacific in fiscal 2023, we think it has room for growth, but it lacks strong retail partnerships and brand recognition. ","We do not believe Under Armour has a moat as we think it lacks the resources to overcome the competitive pressures and industry trends that have hurt its market position over the past few years. The firms adjusted returns on invested capital including goodwill have averaged 9.2% over the past five years, below our estimated weighted average cost of capital of 10.4%. While we estimate its adjusted ROIC including goodwill will exceed its weighted cost of capital over the next decade, we do not have confidence it will generate economic profits for more than 10 years, as would be required for a narrow moat rating.Under Armour is in direct competition with two global companies, Nike and Adidas, which have stronger brand recognition, product lines, and marketing in the United States and international markets. While Under Armour is best known as a producer of high-performance apparel, we do not think its market position is strong enough to provide an economic moat based on a brand intangible asset. Executive chairman Kevin Plank cofounded Under Armour in 1996 on the idea that clothing for football players and other athletes could be more comfortable and improve performance. Under Armour reached milestones like $500 million and $1 billion in sales faster than any other athletic apparel brand. Despite this success, according to Euromonitor, the company only had 2.1% of the global sportswear market in 2023 versus 18% and 8.2% for Nike and Adidas, respectively. Both Nike and Adidas achieve premium pricing based on their strong brands and competitive positioning. They are also more diversified than Under Armour in terms of geography and product assortment, allowing for better relationships with retailers and consumers. We expect much of Under Armours future growth from international markets in which it currently has minimal market share and must compete head-on with Nike and Adidas. Under Armour had just $2 billion in sales outside North America in fiscal 2023, far less than some rivals. Moreover, the firm is increasingly dependent on growth in footwear, where it lacks the styling, distribution, and innovative product of some competitors. We believe it lacks the design talent, marketing, and resources to take share from Nike and Adidas in international markets and athletic shoe categories. Thus, we do not think Under Armour has an economic moat.Weakness in Under Armours competitive position was exposed by past industry turmoil. In 2016, Sports Authority went bankrupt and closed 450 stores. The liquidation of its inventory affected the entire sporting goods business in the U.S. Retailers were stuck with excess inventory and forced to discount and move apparel to off-price channels. The situation worsened when Nike, in an unprecedented move, reduced its minimum advertised price in late 2016. Nike has long been the clear market leader with premium pricing. The change in strategy allowed retailers to advertise discounts of as much as 25% on Nike shoes and apparel in 2017, cutting into Under Armour sales. The company (which had not faced this situation in its 20-year history) and its retail partners were caught by surprise. Since then, similar problems have arisen due to bankruptcies of other sporting goods stores. Now, years later, Under Armours North America sales remain below 2016s level. While Under Armours innovative apparel and technology initially drove significant growth, we believe a lack of barriers to entry and insufficient brand spend impaired its competitive position, and we do not expect these pressures will subside. The first product developed by Plank in 1996 was a moisture-resistant undershirt. Under Armour continues to specialize in performance apparel, being best known for its compression shirts and pants that improve circulation and regulate body temperature. However, many competitors, including Nike and Adidas, have since introduced similar products, and we think this niche is not large enough to provide an economic moat for Under Armour. Moreover, we are uncertain it can maintain any pricing advantage for long as Nike and Adidas have stronger brands and huge marketing budgets. Under Armour apparel prices match or fall short of those of Nike and Adidas in most categories. For example, although Under Armour has a long association with football, its football pants and gloves are priced no higher than similar items from Nike. Moreover, in 2018, Nike won a 10-year extension to its existing National Football League contract that has allowed it to remain the official provider of game-day uniforms and sideline apparel for the NFL. This deal provides unmatched exposure for Nikes football products. We think Under Armour lacks pricing power in most categories of apparel because it does not have a brand intangible asset. We believe Under Armours lack of pricing power in footwear is indicative of a weak competitive position. The prices of Under Armour running and basketball shoes, for example, are below those of Nike and Adidas. At Foot Locker in the U.S., for example, nearly all the mens basketball shoes that retail for more than $120 per pair are produced by Nike or Adidas. Further, while Nike and Adidas have large selections of collectible and fashion sneakers that sell for hundreds or even thousands of dollars per pair, Under Armour lacks any real presence in the category. We believe the firms lack of pricing power in athletic footwear is indicative of a brand without a durable competitive advantage.We think Under Armour cannot match the sponsorships of Nike and Adidas. Under Armour-sponsored athletes include Steph Curry (basketball), Tom Brady (football), Bryce Harper (baseball), and Jordan Spieth (golf). Teams sponsored by Under Armour include the mens and womens U.S. national gymnastics teams, a few college sports programs (including Notre Dame), and professional and club soccer and rugby teams in multiple nations. However, both Nike and Adidas spend more than $1 billion per year on endorsements and boast larger rosters of sponsored athletes, teams, and leagues. Under Armours highest-profile athlete, Steph Curry, left Nike for Under Armour in 2013 and has since launched a brand under his name and signed a long-term deal. However, the Curry signature shoes have had limited success against Nikes dominant basketball offerings. We think Under Armour lacks the visibility necessary to build a brand intangible assets-based moat in the athletic apparel and footwear business.We think Under Armours connected fitness business has been a disappointment and provides no competitive moat. In 2013, Under Armour acquired MapMyFitness for $150 million. Two years later, it acquired MyFitnessPal and Europes Endomondo for a combined $560 million. The firm had a vision of using these apps to build a hardware business, but this strategy was abandoned in 2017. Three years later, it sold MyFitnessPal (for $345 million) and shuttered Endomondo. While Under Armour still operates MapMyFitness, it is not expected to produce material revenue in the foreseeable future. We think Under Armours international business is a growth opportunity for the company but is too small to support a brand intangible asset. In 2008, 95.5% of Under Armours total revenue was generated in North America and international revenue (outside North America) was a mere $32.9 million. In the most recent fiscal year, Under Armours international revenue was $2 billion but the segment remained relatively small at 34% of total sales. Under Armours international sales for the year included $825 million in sales from Asia-Pacific, $993 million in sales from Europe, the Middle East, and Africa, and $213 million in sales from Latin America, but its international business remains insignificant in comparison with Nike and Adidas. Nikes revenue in EMEA, for example, is about 13 times greater than that of Under Armour. While we anticipate Under Armours international revenue will grow faster than its North America revenue over the next decade, we forecast it will remain less than half its total. Moreover, as the firm has consistently reported poor profitability in its immature Latin America market, it is transitioning to third-party distribution in the region. While it achieves solid operating margins in Asia-Pacific (we estimate them at 18% in the long term), competitors operating margins are even higher (generally above 30% for both Nike and Adidas) because they have much greater brand recognition, pricing, distribution, and marketing. We do not think Under Armour can catch up with larger competitors because its product is undifferentiated. The company, closely associated with American football, has no brand or product advantages in most international sports. Moreover, we think Under Armour will struggle to gain any advantage as its marketing and research and development budgets cannot match those of some competitors. So, while we think it has opportunity in large markets like China, we do not think it has any competitive advantages in them at present.We do not believe Under Armour has a moat based on its brand intangible asset or any other source. It has no production cost advantage as its apparel is sourced from third-party manufacturers. We do not believe it has the power to negotiate lower prices from producers. Moreover, we do not think Under Armour is strong enough to sign sponsorship deals with top athletes and teams at below-market prices. Further, the firm has no moat based on efficient scale as its distribution system is like that of competitors. Finally, there is no network effect in the athletic apparel business and switching costs are nonexistent. While Under Armour has some long-term contracts with college and professional teams, individual consumers have many choices in athletic apparel.","We are adjusting our Morningstar Uncertainty Rating on Under Armour to High from Very High based on our quantitative model and the firms more consistent profitability after the pandemic. Under Armour is exposed to weakness in U.S. physical retail. Many U.S. retailers are closing stores or going out of business, including some sporting goods chains, as sales shift to digital and discount channels. For example, in 2016, nationwide sporting goods chain Sports Authority, which had been struggling to compete with wide-moat Walmart and others, went bankrupt and closed all its 450 stores. More recently, Under Armours sales have been negatively affected by inconsistent demand and ordering patterns by third-party retailers.Much of Under Armours growth is expected to come from international markets where its current sales are small. Prior to 2015, Under Armour generated more than 90% of its annual sales in North America. While international sales have grown to about one third of its total sales, the Under Armour brand remains little known in major markets in Europe and Asia. The firm cannot match the endorsement deals that Nike and Adidas have with internationally known athletes and teams.We believe Under Armour has some environmental, social, and governance, or ESG, concerns, but we view the probability of material risk as slight. The firm settled a long-running SEC investigation into its past revenue recognition practices by paying an immaterial $9 million fine. Apart from that, Under Armour, like most international apparel manufacturers, has faced controversy over the treatment of workers in its supply chain.","We assign a Standard capital allocation rating to Under Armour. Cofounder Kevin Plank was replaced as CEO by Patrik Frisk at the beginning of 2020. Frisk, though, did not make as much progress with the firms turnaround as expected and was let go in 2022. Current CEO is Stephanie Linnartz, a former executive at wide-moat Marriott, has experience in building a loyalty program and online tools. Plank, who remains executive chairman, maintains voting control through his ownership of Class B shares. The firm has three classes of stock: A (1 vote per share), B (10 votes per share), and C (no voting rights). Oddly, the Class A shares trade at a premium to the Class C shares even though the voting power of the Class A shares has no apparent value given Planks control. Under Armours free cash flow generation has been inconsistent. Over the past 10 years, its annual free cash flow to the firm averaged only $180 million and was below zero in four of those years. Meanwhile, its yearly capital expenditures averaged $190 million, or 4.2% of sales, over the past decade. We anticipate its capital expenditures will remain relatively high over the next two years as it invests in its Protect This House 3 strategy, but then decline to about 3.5% of sales. We believe Under Armours acquisitions have reduced shareholder value. The firm supported its fledgling connected fitness segment by spending $710 million to acquire three apps. Plank was eager to use these apps as part of a strategy to produce connected clothing and build a fitness hardware business to compete with FitBit and others. At its 2015 analyst day, Under Armour projected $200 million in 2018 revenue for its connected fitness segment. After slow sales, however, it abandoned its fitness hardware business in 2017. In 2019, its connected fitness segment produced just $136 million in revenue and an operating profit of $17 million. In 2020, Under Armour sold one of its acquired apps, MapMyFitness, for $345 million and closed another called Endomondo. We believe the firm overpaid for its fitness apps and may have better served shareholders through other investments.Under Armour made another poor decision when it invested $39 million in Dome, its Japanese licensee, in 2018. It has already written down this investment to zero.Under Armour does not pay a dividend but, with its share price well below previous highs, authorized its first-ever share repurchase program two years ago. The firm repurchased $300 million in shares in February 2022, and then completed $200 million in buybacks in fiscal years 2023 and 2024. We believe Under Armour generates value with repurchases at prices below our fair value estimate (as has recently been the case).","Under Armour develops, markets, and distributes athletic apparel, footwear, and accessories in North America, Asia-Pacific, Europe, and other regions. Consumers of its performance-based clothing and shoes include professional and amateur athletes, sponsored college and professional teams, and people with active lifestyles. The company sells merchandise through direct-to-consumer, including e-commerce and more than 400 combined factory house and brand house stores, and wholesale channels. Under Armour also operates a digital fitness app called MapMyFitness. The Baltimore-based company was founded in 1996.","We believe Under Armour has ample liquidity to get through the current economic environment. As of the end of December 2023, the firm had $1 billion in cash as well as $1.1 billion in borrowing capacity under its revolver. Meanwhile, its debt is limited, consisting of roughly $600 million in 3.25% senior notes that mature in June 2026 and $80 million in convertible debt that matures on June 1, 2024. We anticipate Under Armour will operate in a net cash position. Under Armours free cash flow to the firm has averaged about $440 million per year over the past five years but was negative in fiscal 2023. We forecast its annual free cash flow at only $290 million over the next five fiscal years due to investments related to its Protect This House 3 plan and lower earnings due to low wholesale orders.Although Under Armour does not pay dividends, it recently authorized its first share buyback program. The firm repurchased $300 million in shares in February 2022, and then an additional $200 million (combined) in fiscal years 2023 and 2024. Moreover, its restructuring has reduced base operating expenses by about $200 million, and we forecast its capital expenditures will remain low at 3.5%-4.2% of sales in the long term. Under Armour may use some of its free cash flow for acquisitions, but we do not forecast acquisitions due to the uncertainty concerning timing and size. Although its growth has been largely organic, the firm acquired three fitness apps for a combined $710 million in past years as part of a strategy that has been mostly abandoned. It has also made some smaller investments, such as $39.2 million in its Japanese licensee, Dome, in 2018. Under Armour later had to write down this investment."
27,22/02/2024,"Under Armour Lacks an Advantage, but the Global Sportswear Market Remains Dynamic",Under Armour Inc,UA,5,,David Swartz,8.0,USD,21/02/2024,15.5,High,None,Standard,C,,,"Under Armour has implemented a plan called Protect This House 3 that could make it more competitive. It has introduced a loyalty program, is upgrading its digital capabilities, and is introducing more stylish merchandise. Under Armours restructuring has produced an average annual savings of $200 million. The firm can reinvest these savings into marketing and international expansion while improving its operating margins. Under Armour could gain shelf space and distribution as Nike has reduced or eliminated shipments to some major sportswear retailers.","Inflation and slowing consumer spending on activewear have impeded Under Armours turnaround efforts. Under Armour is exposed to struggling physical retail through its sizable U.S. wholesale business. Some department and sporting goods stores have shuttered locations in recent years. We expect much of Under Armours growth to come from international markets where the brand is little known. It may struggle to compete in China, the worlds second-largest activewear market.",14/02/2024,"We view Under Armour as lacking a moat, given its failure to build a competitive advantage over other athletic apparel firms. Between 2008 and 2016, the firms North American sales increased to $4 billion from $700 million and it passed narrow-moat Adidas as the regions second-largest athletic apparel brand (after wide-moat Nike). However, Under Armours North America sales are little changed over the past seven years as it has been challenged by established competitors and new entrants. While Under Armours new Protect This House 3 plan is designed to make the brand more competitive in the U.S. through its merchandising, e-commerce, and supply chain efforts, we think it has fallen behind some peers on innovation, sponsorships, and style.  Under Armour has recently had problems in both its direct-to-consumer and wholesale businesses. Although annual sales through its direct-to-consumer channels increased to about $2.3 billion in fiscal 2023 from $1.5 billion in 2016, wide-moat Nike and others experienced much greater direct-to-consumer growth in this period. Under Armour has opened its own stores as wholesale distribution has slowed, but 90% of them in North America are off-price. Still, we forecast its direct-to-consumer revenue will rise to 50% of total revenue in fiscal 2033 from 38% in its last fiscal year. This evolution should allow Under Armour to have better control over its brand, but we do not see evidence that it allows for premium pricing and see it as a defensive move. We think Under Armours international segment ($2 billion in sales in fiscal 2023) will produce growth over the long term, but the firm faces significant competition from global and native operators with established brands and distribution networks. According to Euromonitor, the combined sportswear markets in Asia-Pacific and Western Europe totaled about $171 billion at retail in 2023, greater than North America's $158 billion. As Under Armour generated only about 31% of its revenue in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa and Asia-Pacific in fiscal 2023, we think it has room for growth, but it lacks strong retail partnerships and brand recognition. ","We do not believe Under Armour has a moat as we think it lacks the resources to overcome the competitive pressures and industry trends that have hurt its market position over the past few years. The firms adjusted returns on invested capital including goodwill have averaged 9.2% over the past five years, below our estimated weighted average cost of capital of 10.4%. While we estimate its adjusted ROIC including goodwill will exceed its weighted cost of capital over the next decade, we do not have confidence it will generate economic profits for more than 10 years, as would be required for a narrow moat rating.Under Armour is in direct competition with two global companies, Nike and Adidas, which have stronger brand recognition, product lines, and marketing in the United States and international markets. While Under Armour is best known as a producer of high-performance apparel, we do not think its market position is strong enough to provide an economic moat based on a brand intangible asset. Executive chairman Kevin Plank cofounded Under Armour in 1996 on the idea that clothing for football players and other athletes could be more comfortable and improve performance. Under Armour reached milestones like $500 million and $1 billion in sales faster than any other athletic apparel brand. Despite this success, according to Euromonitor, the company only had 2.1% of the global sportswear market in 2023 versus 18% and 8.2% for Nike and Adidas, respectively.

Outside of Deutsche bank, DWS has other long-term distribution agreements, some of which gives it exclusivity/partial exclusivity. Funds managed by DWS have a relatively good performance track record. The asset management business model remains highly cash-generative with limited need for fixed or working capital investment.","DWS has been poorly managed, creating an uncertain environment leading to many talented employees leaving. Lack of strategic direction from Deutsche Bank has been part of the problem. The U.S. operation drags down overall profitability, and there is no indication that DWS would consider selling it. The active asset management industry faces ongoing secular margin pressure.",24/11/2023,"DWS' new management team has made a positive start in stabilizing the business, but organizational culture does not change overnight and we remain concerned that the brand has been damaged by management instability, multiple restructurings, and the well-publicized greenwashing scandal. Over the past decade, DWS has barely seen positive client inflows, lagging its main rivals. Below-average client flows with a reasonable performance track record and some captive/semicaptive distribution agreements in place point to a deeper institutional malaise.  Margin pressure has been less of a concern to DWS than it has been for most of its peers. DWS also has a superior performance track record compared with its peers. Maintaining margins and generating outperformance are arguably the main challenges for most European asset managers.  We believe that DWS' operations in Germany and in the rest of Europe are much more profitable than its U.S. business that contributes the bulk of its revenue outside of Europe. It has been strategically a blunder to hold on to this operation that obscures the strength and profitability of its core German and European operations. DWS operations in the U.S. are largely a separate business unit with its own investment team and back office. It is difficult to see enhanced scalability or any synergies from having a full-scale U.S.-based asset manager.  ","We do not believe DWS benefits from an economic moat. In order to qualify for an economic moat, we must have confidence that a firm will generate economic profits for an extended period. We do not have that confidence in DWS, especially considering its poor long-term track record of investor outflows.Typically, we find economic moats in switching costs and intangible assets for asset managers. Although the switching costs might not be explicitly large, inertia and the uncertainty of achieving better results by moving from one asset manager to another tends to keep many investors invested with the same funds for extended periods of time. To evaluate if switching costs are present, we would turn to the net fund flows (inflows into funds managed by DWS less outflows). DWS has a mixed track record when it comes to client flows. Over the past decade it recorded net client outflows in four years. This makes it very challenging to build an argument that it benefits from switching costs.DWS has a full suite of products, which could support switching costs as it can capture clients looking to move from one investment strategy to another internally. In this regard, we do note DWS' strength in passive investment, with its X-Tracker series of ETFs and its capabilities in alternative investments where it has a strong position especially in real estate. Once again, however, the objective evidence argues against switching costs being present.The switching cost for investors in DWS' retail investment products distributed through Deutsche Bank comes with additional costs as clients of Deutsche Bank will typically have other banking products with it, which could increase the hassle of switching to another intermediary. However, the Deutsche Bank origination channel only accounts for 12% of DWS' assets under management.There are several ways firms can build intangible assets in asset management. We believe there are certain structural attributes (such as product mix, distribution channel concentration, and geographic reach) and intangible assets (such as strong brands and entrenched sales relationships) that can enhance an asset manager's ability to not only attract new assets but retain them for longer periods once they have been collected. Strong historical performance tends to be critical to building a good brand. Above average near- to medium-term performance tends to be a big driver of fund flows. Firms with long records of solid performance build up a reputation that can see them through both good times and bad.The performance of the funds DWS manages has been reasonable. Its strong performance over the longer term where one third of its funds are in the top 20% of funds in its category over 10 years is particularly striking. However, its shorter-term performance has been more middling, with the 23% of funds in the top quintile arguably being offset by 22% residing in the bottom quintile. Performance has undoubtedly suffered because of the high level of uncertainty that has prevailed at DWS and its parent Deutsche Bank since the financial crisis of 2008. Asset management is a talent business, which is why People is one of the three pillars used by Morningstar Manager Research to evaluate funds, together with Process and Parent. The tumultuous few years that DWS has been through over the past few years has not been conducive to retaining top talent. DWS has a relationship agreement with Deutsche Bank, whereby Deutsche Bank agrees that DWS ""is intended to be the primary means of carrying out asset management business within the group...."" The agreement is in place till 2028. This is a weaker agreement than others at some of DWS' peers. Other captive distribution agreements at DWS' European peers include exclusive distribution clauses or require a minimum portion of investor product sales to be products from the captive manager. Deutsche Bank, however, offers clients a limited choice of products from competing asset managers. As is the case in much of Europe, banks are the main distributors of retail investment products in Germany. In some European markets, notably France, the distributing banks offer mainly in-house products. This is not the case in Germany were investors have a greater choice of third-party funds. Assets sold via Deutsche Bank's network made up 12% of DWS' assets under management in 2018 and 25% of its German assets under management. Under the relationship agreement, DWS can also continue to use Deutsche Bank's brand, should it wish to do so. Even prior to the spin out, DWS already tried to build its own brand separate from the Deutsche Bank brand. The Deutsche Bank brand has suffered significant damage after the crisis, and we do not believe it is at all supportive of a moatif anything the opposite applies, and one of DWS' main challenges will be to establish a separate brand.","We believe our fair value estimate for DWS is subject to High Uncertainty. By its nature, fund management is a cyclical business. Management fees are directly correlated to the level of markets, while performance fees further increase cyclicality as managers tend to earn far greater performance fees during bull markets. Client investment flows also tend to dry up during bear markets, which exacerbates cyclicality even more. Asset managers also tend to have reasonably high levels of operating leverage as their cost bases are dominated by fixed costs. DWS' balance sheet is also directly exposed to some market risk. To start up a new fund often requires DWS to stump up an initial investment or seed money. This is on balance seed money that is exposed to the vagaries of the market, sometimes in new and unproven strategies, exposing DWS to market risk. It is our understanding that around 20% of DWS capital is invested as seed money or as co-investments.","We view DWS' capital allocation rating as Poor. The most important asset for an active asset manager is its people. DWS has not been safeguarding this asset. The uncertainty that has prevailed at DWS would not only have made it hard to retain its most-talented employees, it would undoubtedly have led to poor decision-making from employees faced with job insecurity and a muddled strategy. The decision to keep its poorly performing U.S. operation is a good example of poor capital allocation. The U.S. is a highly competitive market where DWS has no clear competitive advantage or dominance in any niche.","Until 2018, DWS was fully owned by Deutsche Bank, which retains a 79% interest in DWS. DWS' home German market remains importantcontributing around 40% of assets under managementthe EMEA region in total accounts for 70% of assets under management, and the Americas contributes nearly all of the balance, with a small Asian presence. Assets from institutional clients make up 55% of overall assets under management.","We believe DWS is financially very sound. DWS has virtually no long-term debt outstanding on its balance sheet, and it is highly cash generative with limited fixed or working capital needs. Questions could be asked around the valuation of the goodwill on DWS' balance sheet, its return on equity (inclusive of goodwill) is currently not above its cost of capital, which could point to the need to impair goodwill. This would, however, be a noncash charge that will not have an impact on the solvency or liquidity of DWS."
