## Market Data
The dedicated market data is pulled from yahoo finance via the (unofficial) Python API. We pulled daily (EOD) data on OHLCV (Open High Low Close Volume) 30 (or 60) days before and after the release of the reports. We also included the company's ```Sector```, the	```MarketCap```	and its traded ```Exchange```. Unfortunately the ```TickerSymbol``` of the analyst report is not specific enough. Thats why the [Jupyter notebook '2. Data Merge'](https://github.com/trashpanda-ai/Analyst-Reports-NLP-/blob/e2b421149b506df3004cbe21ee8ec53f33352a56/2.%20Data%20Merge.ipynb) shows a detailed approach how to find the actual ticker symbols.

## Load Data

```
import json
import pandas as pd

# Load the data from the JSON file
with open('Data/Market Data/30d_data/JSON/all_data.json') as f:
    all_data_60 = json.load(f)

# Convert each item in the dictionary back into a DataFrame
all_data_60_df = {key: pd.read_json(value, orient='columns') for key, value in all_data_60.items()}

df = pd.read_csv('Data/final_data.csv', index_col=0)
```


Info: ```final_data.csv``` is a combination of the Morningstar reports and a usable ticker symbol to pull the yahoo data.
